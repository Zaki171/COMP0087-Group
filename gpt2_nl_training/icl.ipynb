The patient recalls that shortly before the onset of these symptoms, he had a low-grade fever, malaise, and sore throat which resolved after a few days with over the counter medications. He does not have any chronic illnesses and denies recent travel or illicit habits. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), and regular radial pulse 90/min. While checking his blood pressure manually, the difference between the systolic pressure at which the first Korotkoff sounds are heard during expiration and the pressure at which they are heard throughout the respiratory cycle is less than 10 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is in mild distress with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 13 cm, and his heart sounds are muffled. His echocardiography shows a fluid collection in the pericardial sac with no evidence of right ventricular compression.
