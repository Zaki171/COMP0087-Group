The patient recalls that shortly before the onset of these symptoms, he had a low-grade fever, malaise, and sore throat which resolved after a few days with over the counter medications. He does not have any chronic illnesses and denies recent travel or illicit habits. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), and regular radial pulse 90/min. While checking his blood pressure manually, the difference between the systolic pressure at which the first Korotkoff sounds are heard during expiration and the pressure at which they are heard throughout the respiratory cycle is less than 10 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is in mild distress with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 13 cm, and his heart sounds are muffled. His echocardiography shows a fluid collection in the pericardial sac with no evidence of right ventricular compression.

As far as inheritance of this condition is concerned, it is a sporadic type of neural tube defect.

      "    Mutations in the KRT10 gene cause ichthyosis with confetti. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 10, which is found in cells called keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis). In the fluid-filled space inside these cells (the cytoplasm), this tough, fibrous protein attaches to another keratin protein (produced from a different gene) to form fibers called intermediate filaments.\n",

      "Signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) include unexplained shortness of breath, problems breathing, chest pain, coughing, or coughing up blood. An arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) also may suggest that you have PE.\n",
      "PREDICTION:\n",
      " \n",
      "    Pulmonary embolism is not usually associated with particular symptoms, but rather there are a constellation of complaints that are the basis for considering this diagnosis. Patients present with a varying degree of dyspnea, the most common and constant sign. Dyspnea can be worsened by exertion but can occur at rest. Other common manifestations of pulmonary embolism are chest pain, cough.\n",

      "    Is Protein C deficiency inherited ?\n",
      "    ### Response:\n",
      "    How is protein C deficiency inherited? Hereditary protein C deficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one mutated copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause mild protein C deficiency. A mutated copy of the gene can be inherited from a person's mother or father.\n",

      "    Is Carney complex inherited ?\n",
      "    ### Response:\n",
      "    Carney complex is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In approximately 80 percent of cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.\n",

      "    Is Gordon syndrome inherited ?\n",
      "    ### Response:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " How is Gordon syndrome inherited? While some reports suggest Gordon syndrome may be inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, most agree that it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced expressivity and incomplete penetrance in females. In autosomal dominant inheritance, having only one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause signs and symptoms of the condition.\n",
      "PREDICTION:\n",
      " \n",
      "    The exact inheritance pattern is unclear because affected individuals are so rare and often do not have children.\n",

      "    Is Turner’s syndrome inherited ?\n",
      "    ### Response:\n",
      "    The inheritance pattern of Turner syndrome is unknown in most cases, because nearly all patients do not have healthy pregnancies.\n",

      "    ### Instruction:\n",
      "    Is Proteus syndrome hereditary ?\n",
      "    ### Response:\n",
      "    Yes, Proteus syndrome is a rare inherited condition in which affected individuals are born with extra tissue in their bones and organs. Males are more often affected than females. Other features of this condition include overgrowth of the extremities, such as fingers and toes, which causes the affected body parts...\n",
