In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question.

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question.

The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX will be seen as what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail if the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. In the gift-giving example, X may be seen as generous or giving. In contrast, in an event such as PersonX steals a car, PersonX may be perceived as evil.

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous.

In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

      " ### Inputs: What a stunning episode for this fine series. This is television excellence at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and it's beautifully filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit, and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, \"Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,\" as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful.\n",

Later, many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains. A Norman named Oursel led a force of 'Franks' into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans—formerly of Oursel—led by Raimbaud. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning 'Franks.' The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy. Question: Who did the Normans team up with in Anatolia?\n",

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous.

In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question.

The computer graphics were worse than in \"Tron.\" Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what's the point.The only good thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it.

      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " The 5th Amendment of the US Constitution protects a person's right to due process and protects against being compelled to be a witness against oneself in a criminal case. It states that no one may be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” This means that the government may not take away someone's life, freedom, or possessions without following proper legal procedures. Additionally, the 5th Amendment protects individuals from being tried for the same crime twice.\n",

Some marathons may require entrants to provide proof of their fitness level via a doctor's note or other form of approval. Additionally, age and disability categories might be considered to ensure equality and safety. Marathon organizers may also require entrants to have completed a training program, or complete a race before the event.\n",

      " Mrs. Smith had been living in the same small town for most of her life and now at the ripe old age of ninety, she decided it was time to do something new. After seeing her neighbor’s flourishing garden, she decided to start one of her own. She had never done anything like this before, but she was not afraid of a challenge. With help from her family and her community, she was soon able to create a beautiful small garden in her backyard with various plants and flowers. She found joy in tending to her garden, and it soon became a source of comfort for her.\n",

      " ### Output:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " Global warming has had a significant impact on the environment. The Earth’s average temperature has risen substantially, resulting in increased sea levels, extreme weather events, and greater threats to biodiversity. Additionally, climate change has caused acidification of the oceans, changes in soil structure, and a decrease in crop yields. These effects are likely to worsen in the future as temperatures continue to increase due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effects of global warming can lead to other problems such as population displacement and decreased access to food, water, and other essential resources, causing poverty and ultimately, conflict. Global warming is a pressing issue and requires international cooperation and coordinated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and protect resources.\n",

      " Global warming has had a significant impact on the environment. The Earth’s average temperature has risen substantially, resulting in increased sea levels, extreme weather events, and greater threats to biodiversity. Additionally, climate change has caused acidification of the oceans, changes in soil structure, and a decrease in crop yields. These effects are likely to worsen in the future as temperatures continue to increase due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effects of global warming can lead to other problems such as population displacement and decreased access to food, water, and other essential resources, causing poverty and ultimately, conflict. Global warming is a pressing issue and requires international cooperation and coordinated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and protect resources.\n",

      " ### Instruction: Explain the concept of angles of elevation and angles of depression.\n",
      " ### Input: \n",
      " ### Output: Angles of elevation and angles of depression are used in trigonometry to measure the angle formed in relationship to a horizontal. An angle of elevation is the angle above the horizontal line and an angle of depression is the angle below the horizontal line. In either case, the angle is formed between the horizontal line, the observer, and the object being viewed. For example, if a person is standing on an elevated point and looking up at an object, the angle between the object and the person’s eye is the angle of elevation. Likewise, if the person is looking down at an object, the angle is the angle of depression.\n",

Traditional programming is restrictive as it is limited to a predetermined set of outcomes based on conditions set by the programmer. However, GPT models are able to generate new outcomes based on the input it receives, removing the need for predefined programming logic. Additionally, GPT models understand natural language, giving it the ability to respond to more complex user queries instead of relying on rigid keyword-based programming.\n",

The Earth’s average temperature has risen substantially, resulting in increased sea levels, extreme weather events, and greater threats to biodiversity. Additionally, climate change has caused acidification of the oceans, changes in soil structure, and a decrease in crop yields. These effects are likely to worsen in the future as temperatures continue to increase due to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effects of global warming can lead to other problems such as population displacement and decreased access to food, water, and other essential resources, causing poverty and ultimately, conflict. Global warming is a pressing issue and requires international cooperation and coordinated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and protect resources.\n",

No, I fully understand your question, Mehdi, because we always say, well, we have very long lead times in the supply chain, which is true for the critical suppliers like, for instance, ZEISS. We have, in the end, if you take Tier 2 also thousands of suppliers, which some of them have lead times which are a lot shorter. We've had delays in EUV in Q1 of a couple of weeks because one particular supplier couldn't provide rings, your flow rings, which is not the most advanced part that we need. But if you don't have it, you don't have it. So this is where our concern comes from. It's the tiered supply chain, which is not always that visible to us.  We have tiered suppliers coming from Malaysia, Mexico, you name it, and they are supplying to our Tier 2 and Tier 1 suppliers. And if that supply basically stops then even a part that has a relatively short lead time doesn't arrive on time, and we get a delay. I think, ultimately, we get those parts, it's just a delay. And if we tell you, if we give you a number and we get a significant delay in some of those short lead-time parts, we cannot ship tools and that can be significant. You may remember that the 3400C now is EUR 130 million tool. That's a big number. And I don't want to give you a range from x billion to y billion. That doesn't make sense, yes? So this is where it comes from, yes?  And I think it is really based on the experience that we've had in Q1 where we were able to manage it, but we did see some delays. And since we cannot judge what the impact will be of these governmental orders in different parts of the world, we cannot assess what that risk is. But it's there because we've seen it. We've been able to manage it with a lot of creativity. It doesn't give me any assurance or certainty that we will be able to manage it going forward always. So this is where it comes from.\n",

And so we would obviously expect, particularly in DRAM, that cost will be good. As we said, replacement gate might not be where we want it to be, in the very first generation. But one of the advantages of carrying the inventory we're carrying, 64-layer and 96-layer inventory in the next year is that it has a very good cost structure, and so we should have a good cost structure in 2020 on NAND as well. The other thing, on utilization, just  I just want to make sure it's clear what period cost means is we will take that expense kind of as it comes in the quarters in which we take the underutilization. It won't roll up into inventory. It won't be counted as part of the cost. So obviously, it will have an impact on margins.

Amy, just a general sort of corporate-wide question on gross margins. Your revenue and COGS guide, if I ran the math correctly, imply about 60% gross margins for the December quarter. So that's going to be down year-over-year and I suspect below some of the street estimates, but it sounds like your tone is a little bit better for gross margins for the full year. So I just want to make sure I leave the call understanding what's happening here is the conclusion that 2Q is somewhat of a one-off, given the uptick in lower-margin hardware and thereafter will return to a more normal year-over-year pattern on gross margins.\n",

      " ### Text:  Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]  Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by a discussion of the impact of tax reform and then end with Q3 guidance. Q2 was a strong quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We executed well in a number of areas, including good orders momentum, solid revenue growth and strong margins and cash flow. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, up 3%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion, up 10%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. Operating cash flow grew 8% to $4.1 billion, with free cash flow up 10%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin rate to 31.7%, up 0.7 points. Let me provide more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 3%. Infrastructure platforms returned to growth, up 2%, with broad strength across the businesses. Within Switching, we had strong growth in data center switching, and we're seeing great momentum with our new campus switch, the Cat 9K. We also had strong Wireless growth, driven by our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Data Center was up double digits, driven by server products as well as our HyperFlex offerings. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in our routing products, driven by continued weakness in Service Provider. Let's move on to applications. Applications is made up of our collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, conferencing and TelePresence; as well as our IoT and application software businesses, Jasper and AppDynamics. Applications was up 6% in total, with strength in TelePresence and conferencing as well as AppDynamics, offset by some weakness in UC endpoints. There was also a strong increase in deferred revenue, up 18%. Security was up 6%, with strong performance in unified threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 3%, driven by growth in software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q2, we generated 33% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 19% and services up 4%. Deferred revenue, product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.5 billion, up 36%. We saw strong momentum in Q2 product orders, growing 5% in total. Looking in our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was flat. Total emerging markets was up 1%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 1%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 3%, commercial grew 14%, public sector was up 8% and service provider declined 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 growth margin was 64.7%, up 0.6 points. Product gross margin was 63.3%, up 0.9 points. And service gross margin was 68.5%, down 0.3 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 31.7%, up 0.7 points. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.78, driven by the onetime charges related to U.S. tax reform. We're very pleased with the tax rate reduction related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since our fiscal year ends in July, we won't realize a full benefit this year but will start  and we will start to realize that full year's worth in fiscal year '19. For Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% to adjust to our full year estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. We are currently forecasting our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year '19 to be 20%. This quarter, we incurred an $11.1 billion charge to our income tax provision that is comprised of $9 billion related to the U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $0.9 billion for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets related with the lower tax rate. Our Q2 GAAP tax rate includes the impact of this charge while our non-GAAP rate excludes it. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $73.7 billion, with $2.4 billion available in the U.S. We plan on repatriating $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. in Q3 of fiscal year '18. Q2 operating cash flow of $4.1 billion reflects strong growth of 8%. Free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 10% to $3.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $4 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we announced a $0.04 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share, up 14% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3.1% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $25 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $31 billion. We expect to utilize this over the next 18 to 24 months. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter with solid top line growth, strong profitability, cash flows and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We closed the acquisition of BroadSoft in early Q3, and the impact of the acquisition is factored into our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.64 to $0.66. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n",

      " ### Text: Yes. So the  we're very excited about the opportunities for us in the commercial space. And I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street as well as just general go-to-market around commercial. Starting with Ryzen, I think you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger, and it's not just the number of platforms but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well. What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is the stronger part of the PC market. And we'll continue to talk about that.  As it relates to new platforms, certainly as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think you'll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We're investing heavily in security and manageability and all of those other aspects that are important in the commercial space. As it relates to EPYC in the Enterprise, I'm actually very encouraged with what we see in the Enterprise. We had originally said that we thought we would be more cloud  sort of cloud would go first and then Enterprise would take longer. I think what we currently see is cloud is certainly a big driver of our business. But our Enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I really would say that the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly. We have had a number of engagements, and I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in Enterprise across our top OEMs has increased very significantly just in the last sort of 2 months since we launched. So the awareness around EPYC as well as the awareness around these new platforms, I think, is strong, and we'll continue to build that out as we go forward.\n",

Our inventory levels that we are holding here, they are definitely going to swing a bit in terms of the mix, in terms of our platforms. But what we have right now, we do have a very healthy level of inventory. And we have a great team of people managing all of those different pieces, both for the channel, for our partners, and definitely for what we need to ship going forward.

We're focused on certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So things that we're really excited about, stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are and share their story. So we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content, and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think broadly, with advertising, so much of this is about having  developing great relationships with these advertisers because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this, given our retail business. On the advertising business  or rather, I should say, other revenue, that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. That line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is, as a subset, been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.\n",

Achieve this through increasing engagement in shopping through our own retail businesses; strengthening relationships with customers and partners to expand our base of potential advertising customers and increase brand spend through advertising.

And when I look at consensus expectations, basically if I assume there is about like $2 billion of EUV revenues  sorry, EUR 2 billion of EUV revenues with about 20 tools, then that implies the DUV business would be down about $1 billion in 2018.

Really, it has been, and is that transactional component. You're right, we continue to see the annuity growth. We continue see the growth through Azure, and the offset to that has been the transactional business. I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason, other than  that's changed my world view, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tends to exert itself on that transactional business. But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continuing to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change, outside of that component we discussed. In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the intelligent cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%, but that 20%, right, lends itself in quarter to the volatility you see. The productivity and business process segment has a bit more transactional exposure, just because it has both the consumer and commercial office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs. So it's slightly higher, all up.\n",

      " ### Text:  Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]  Thanks, Mark. Q3 was an outstanding quarter, which produced records in a number of product lines, and serves as evidence of our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices. As a great proof point, third-quarter revenue grew 9% over last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses. I'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now. I'll start with the client computing group, which had a stellar quarter. This team's focus on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, improving product costs, and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins. The client computing group's revenue grew 5% over last year, but just as importantly, DCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation. In the data center group, revenue grew 10% year over year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the data center group accelerating at a rate above our forecast. The cloud service provider segment was up 32%. In the [com] service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth, as the market converts to NFE and SDN and demand for our products increase. In addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%. This category includes our new omni-path high-performance fabric, which is leading in performance and gaining design-win momentum. It includes our Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began their ramps this year. However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year over year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the full year will likely be in the high single digits. Another key growth opportunity for Intel, our Internet of Things business, grew 19% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $700 million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video, and transportation segments. Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year over year. 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule, with yields matching those of our other production facilities. We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology, 3D Crosspoint, and we're making steady progress toward bringing it into production. Intel's programmable solutions group, formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wireline, industrial, and broadcast segments. I'm very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continued to execute against our [deal thesis], and PSG has produced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera's results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges. In the third quarter, we began sampling our Stratix 10 product, Intel's first FPGA produced on our own process technology, and also, the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA. We are shipping our first co-packaged parts for the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with PSG products across many of Intel's businesses. PSG's results show the tremendous progress and execution. The Intel security business was up 6% over last year. Last month we announced that we will sell 51% of Intel security to private equity firm TPG, and establish a jointly-owned, independent cybersecurity Company named McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent Company while allowing Intel to continue to participate in McAfee's success and growth. Intel's transformation continues and the restructuring program that we've announced in April remains on track. I'm really proud of the work our employees are doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard, and going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed, and resilient this team is. And finally, I'd like to welcome Bob to the Company as our Chief Financial Officer. He brings a wealth of leadership experience to Intel, and his financial acumen and strategic insights will be an asset to the Company. At the same time, I'd like to thank Stacy for an outstanding nine years as CFO. He's been a great partner, and I'm excited to have his leadership in manufacturing, sales, and operations moving forward. Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with our results in the third quarter. We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials, and continued to realign our resources to our strategy. The progress we're making leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.\n",

For the last several quarters here it's been accelerating on a year-on-year basis, and I think this quarter 24% was below the 26% that you reported in Q4 of 2015. Just curious what had been driving the acceleration over the past few quarters, and what may be changed this quarter? And then in terms of the Q1 revenue guidance, wondering if you could provide a little bit of color in terms of the impact that maybe the recent AWS price adjustments are having on your Q1 guidance?

We've extended that and begun to extend it to the PC. We're extending it to mobile. That platform strength will drive this more annuity-like behavior that you're thinking about, which is great. And we saw that in the Game Pass subscription growth again this quarter, building on that base. But then the third-party titles will drive some volatility, but that volatility is just reinforcing of the position we have and I think the long relationship with fans.

And then maybe this one will be a little clearer on the long-term side of things. An earlier question was asked about OpEx and expanding your capabilities, et cetera, and you gave a thoughtful answer to that. But generally speaking, it seems like your opportunities to take share in aggregate just improved due to your competitors' missteps.  So when you look at that opportunity, how do you think about organic investments? Would OpEx staying at, say, 29% of revenues like you're talking about for this year, be a good way to capitalize on that opportunity as opposed to going down to the 26% or 27% you mentioned at your analyst meeting? Or within that, would you keep that a little bit tighter in line with your analyst meeting and maybe even consider going inorganic and tapping into the M&A market now that you have some cash and a very attractive currency to use as well?\n",

So we're working very hard with ZEISS to make sure that we can get a bit more output. But as we currently see it, I mean, we've mentioned in all of the numbers, which are up 20 for next year, at least 30 for 2019 and 40-plus for 2020, that is what our current planning is. But we also have started to run programs with our supply chain to shorter  to shorten the lead time and to shorter the cycle time in their factory.

      "### Text:  Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [31]  Yes. No, I fully understand your question, Mehdi, because we always say, well, we have very long lead times in the supply chain, which is true for the critical suppliers like, for instance, ZEISS. We have, in the end, if you take Tier 2 also thousands of suppliers, which some of them have lead times which are a lot shorter. We've had delays in EUV in Q1 of a couple of weeks because one particular supplier couldn't provide rings, your flow rings, which is not the most advanced part that we need. But if you don't have it, you don't have it. So this is where our concern comes from. It's the tiered supply chain, which is not always that visible to us.  We have tiered suppliers coming from Malaysia, Mexico, you name it, and they are supplying to our Tier 2 and Tier 1 suppliers. And if that supply basically stops then even a part that has a relatively short lead time doesn't arrive on time, and we get a delay. I think, ultimately, we get those parts, it's just a delay. And if we tell you, if we give you a number and we get a significant delay in some of those short lead-time parts, we cannot ship tools and that can be significant. You may remember that the 3400C now is EUR 130 million tool. That's a big number. And I don't want to give you a range from x billion to y billion. That doesn't make sense, yes? So this is where it comes from, yes?  And I think it is really based on the experience that we've had in Q1 where we were able to manage it, but we did see some delays. And since we cannot judge what the impact will be of these governmental orders in different parts of the world, we cannot assess what that risk is. But it's there because we've seen it. We've been able to manage it with a lot of creativity. It doesn't give me any assurance or certainty that we will be able to manage it going forward always. So this is where it comes from.\n",

So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product. So it will be  it is in there in terms of the bookings. Now split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate their lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND, and there are a lot of relocations going on between DRAM and NAND.

But one of the advantages of carrying the inventory we're carrying, 64-layer and 96-layer inventory in the next year is that it has a very good cost structure, and so we should have a good cost structure in 2020 on NAND as well. The other thing, on utilization, just  I just want to make sure it's clear what period cost means is we will take that expense kind of as it comes in the quarters in which we take the underutilization. It won't roll up into inventory. It won't be counted as part of the cost. So obviously, it will have an impact on margins.

When you think about our gross margins, just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs. We benefited from that with a higher gross margin as we filled and completed that. You've seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We're not here to be able to forecast, generally, when those pricing of those components will stabilize. But we believe in terms of the value added that our platforms provide, the components are an important part of finishing that.

      "### Text:  Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]  Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by a discussion of the impact of tax reform and then end with Q3 guidance. Q2 was a strong quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We executed well in a number of areas, including good orders momentum, solid revenue growth and strong margins and cash flow. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, up 3%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion, up 10%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. Operating cash flow grew 8% to $4.1 billion, with free cash flow up 10%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin rate to 31.7%, up 0.7 points. Let me provide more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 3%. Infrastructure platforms returned to growth, up 2%, with broad strength across the businesses. Within Switching, we had strong growth in data center switching, and we're seeing great momentum with our new campus switch, the Cat 9K. We also had strong Wireless growth, driven by our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Data Center was up double digits, driven by server products as well as our HyperFlex offerings. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in our routing products, driven by continued weakness in Service Provider. Let's move on to applications. Applications is made up of our collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, conferencing and TelePresence; as well as our IoT and application software businesses, Jasper and AppDynamics. Applications was up 6% in total, with strength in TelePresence and conferencing as well as AppDynamics, offset by some weakness in UC endpoints. There was also a strong increase in deferred revenue, up 18%. Security was up 6%, with strong performance in unified threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 3%, driven by growth in software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q2, we generated 33% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 19% and services up 4%. Deferred revenue, product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.5 billion, up 36%. We saw strong momentum in Q2 product orders, growing 5% in total. Looking in our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was flat. Total emerging markets was up 1%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 1%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 3%, commercial grew 14%, public sector was up 8% and service provider declined 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 growth margin was 64.7%, up 0.6 points. Product gross margin was 63.3%, up 0.9 points. And service gross margin was 68.5%, down 0.3 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 31.7%, up 0.7 points. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.78, driven by the onetime charges related to U.S. tax reform. We're very pleased with the tax rate reduction related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since our fiscal year ends in July, we won't realize a full benefit this year but will start  and we will start to realize that full year's worth in fiscal year '19. For Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% to adjust to our full year estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. We are currently forecasting our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year '19 to be 20%. This quarter, we incurred an $11.1 billion charge to our income tax provision that is comprised of $9 billion related to the U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $0.9 billion for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets related with the lower tax rate. Our Q2 GAAP tax rate includes the impact of this charge while our non-GAAP rate excludes it. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $73.7 billion, with $2.4 billion available in the U.S. We plan on repatriating $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. in Q3 of fiscal year '18. Q2 operating cash flow of $4.1 billion reflects strong growth of 8%. Free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 10% to $3.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $4 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we announced a $0.04 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share, up 14% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3.1% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $25 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $31 billion. We expect to utilize this over the next 18 to 24 months. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter with solid top line growth, strong profitability, cash flows and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We closed the acquisition of BroadSoft in early Q3, and the impact of the acquisition is factored into our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.64 to $0.66. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n",

We have over 1 billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours, and in fact, 80% of YouTube's views are from outside of the US. It's been an incredible year where I feel the team is on fire, focusing on launching YouTube Red, YouTube Music, and as you saw at Sundance a big push on YouTube originals, with a focus from our top creators, to create exclusive content for YouTube Red users.

So like we anticipated, as we are so rapidly ramping the Cat 9K and as we are blowing out DNA across not only that, but also our Viptela offerings and across wireless, the revenue headwind was getting more closer to 2.5 to 3 points. Now the good news on this is with the new revenue standard going forward, because it's accelerating some of these offers that we did have previously defer, that headwind will become less of a headwind, okay? So as opposed to the 2.5 to 3 under current accounting standards, that will be much less, closer to like 1.5 point or so, if I had to guess roughly. And again, this will all flush out as we go through it, but it will become less of a headwind because we have such a big portion of things that we will now be recognizing upfront.\n",

I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color, which segments does it seem to resonate with? To what extent is it a commercial versus a consumer product? And do you think that the Ryzen notebook opportunity, is it bigger than the desktop opportunity ultimately in your minds?\n",
      " ### Targets: positive\n",
      "### Text: Yes. So the  we're very excited about the opportunities for us in the commercial space. And I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street as well as just general go-to-market around commercial. Starting with Ryzen, I think you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger, and it's not just the number of platforms but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well. What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is the stronger part of the PC market. And we'll continue to talk about that.  As it relates to new platforms, certainly as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think you'll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We're investing heavily in security and manageability and all of those other aspects that are important in the commercial space. As it relates to EPYC in the Enterprise, I'm actually very encouraged with what we see in the Enterprise. We had originally said that we thought we would be more cloud  sort of cloud would go first and then Enterprise would take longer. I think what we currently see is cloud is certainly a big driver of our business. But our Enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I really would say that the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly. We have had a number of engagements, and I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in Enterprise across our top OEMs has increased very significantly just in the last sort of 2 months since we launched. So the awareness around EPYC as well as the awareness around these new platforms, I think, is strong, and we'll continue to build that out as we go forward.\n",

And as you've seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we're still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It's ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than 1/4 of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow.  We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3.\n",

But what we have right now, we do have a very healthy level of inventory. And we have a great team of people managing all of those different pieces, both for the channel, for our partners, and definitely for what we need to ship going forward.  So I don't think we look at a number to exactly optimize in any single one quarter, as we do make sure that we are prepared for the platforms coming down the pipeline, as well as what customers need.

And just wonder, first, do you generally agree with this? And if so, what is the company doing to kind of better optimize these increasingly related functions that maybe, in the past, haven't always been organized internally that way? And then secondly, in terms of subscription revenue, where are we in terms of the benefit from the price increase announcement announced last year and rolled through to existing members throughout the last year? And will this have any meaningful impact in that line's growth, say, in Q3 or the back half of the year?\n",

      "### Text: Yes. Dan, in terms of your question around brands. We're focused on certainly brands as an advertising customer set and a lot of focus on providing the products and tools that are going to help customers and really inspire them. So things that we're really excited about, stores, so a brand can customize and curate a multipage store. It allows them to better tell customers who they are and share their story. So we can help deepen the brand engagement and the customer loyalty through that type of option. Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands. And it's through a curated feed that features the brand's lifestyle content, and it's on a mobile detail page. And there's international expansion in some other areas. I think broadly, with advertising, so much of this is about having  developing great relationships with these advertisers because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes. We're uniquely positioned to do this, given our retail business. On the advertising business  or rather, I should say, other revenue, that line item grew about 41% year-over-year. Advertising is the biggest piece of that. That line item is growing at about the same rate. Advertising revenue is, as a subset, been growing at about the same rate year-over-year in the fourth quarter than it did in the third quarter.\n",

I think  what I think, it's probably best is we look at our Analyst Day of 2016. We gave you a couple of scenarios where high EUV introduction, lower EUV introduction for several reasons. It could be EUV not as effective as we then, at that moment in time, planned or whether markets were different. And you can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower immersion, but still significant. And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple patterning layers. On the other hand also, layers are growing, yes? So it also  so basically, there is a dilutive effect in that sense that you have more layers, and some of those layers will be deep UV layers, will be the immersion layers. So no matter how you look at it, the number of EUV and of immersion systems will still remain significant, also with high EUV introduction. So  this is I'd like to refer back to that  to those 4 scenarios that we showed in the end of 2016.\n",

We had it at about 15% of total YouTube revenue. And then how is the faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long-term profitability goals at YouTube? And then the second question is on Search. So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year-on-year is pretty encouraging. If we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre-COVID levels in those areas?\n",

So I think you laid out the kind of EUV puts and takes, but also you said the lengths of the 10 nanometer and then 7 nanometer nodes and I think you also just said that you expect that to continue into next year. I think TSMC raised CapEx, they also said they have more customer interest at 7 nanometer than they had previously expected. So I guess my question is how conservative is the implied revenue run rate, which I believe is around EUR1.6 billion for Q4, as you see things right now? And then my second question was on EUV, you have a backlog of 10 tools now. Could you just kindly let us know how many customers make up those 10 tools? And also what is the magnitude of potential further orders in the second half of this year or will 2017 be a meaningfully bigger year potentially for EUV orders just so we know what to look for? Thank you.\n",

You'll have more in the next couple of quarters. So next year, like 20, 22 is also probably what we are going to see. And at the same time, I heard also that the DUV business is likely to do well in 2018 as well because, mostly because of China generating like a new area of demand in DUV. And when I look at consensus expectations, basically if I assume there is about like $2 billion of EUV revenues  sorry, EUR 2 billion of EUV revenues with about 20 tools, then that implies the DUV business would be down about $1 billion in 2018. Do you think that kind of pullback makes sense and would reflect maybe like a sustaining of the rollout of the 10-nanometer node? Or do you think actually to 28 and could be another very strong year in DUV?\n",

Really, it has been, and is that transactional component. You're right, we continue to see the annuity growth. We continue see the growth through Azure, and the offset to that has been the transactional business. I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason, other than  that's changed my world view, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tends to exert itself on that transactional business. But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continuing to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change, outside of that component we discussed. In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the intelligent cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%, but that 20%, right, lends itself in quarter to the volatility you see. The productivity and business process segment has a bit more transactional exposure, just because it has both the consumer and commercial office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs.

So if I look at the cloud CapEx, they were up about 70%. If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, it was up about 60%.

And then I have a follow-up in 2020.\n",

      "### Text:  Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]  Thanks, Mark. Q3 was an outstanding quarter, which produced records in a number of product lines, and serves as evidence of our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices. As a great proof point, third-quarter revenue grew 9% over last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses. I'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now. I'll start with the client computing group, which had a stellar quarter. This team's focus on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, improving product costs, and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins. The client computing group's revenue grew 5% over last year, but just as importantly, DCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation. In the data center group, revenue grew 10% year over year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the data center group accelerating at a rate above our forecast. The cloud service provider segment was up 32%. In the [com] service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth, as the market converts to NFE and SDN and demand for our products increase. In addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%. This category includes our new omni-path high-performance fabric, which is leading in performance and gaining design-win momentum. It includes our Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began their ramps this year. However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year over year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the full year will likely be in the high single digits. Another key growth opportunity for Intel, our Internet of Things business, grew 19% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $700 million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video, and transportation segments. Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year over year. 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule, with yields matching those of our other production facilities. We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology, 3D Crosspoint, and we're making steady progress toward bringing it into production. Intel's programmable solutions group, formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wireline, industrial, and broadcast segments. I'm very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continued to execute against our [deal thesis], and PSG has produced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera's results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges. In the third quarter, we began sampling our Stratix 10 product, Intel's first FPGA produced on our own process technology, and also, the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA. We are shipping our first co-packaged parts for the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with PSG products across many of Intel's businesses. PSG's results show the tremendous progress and execution. The Intel security business was up 6% over last year. Last month we announced that we will sell 51% of Intel security to private equity firm TPG, and establish a jointly-owned, independent cybersecurity Company named McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent Company while allowing Intel to continue to participate in McAfee's success and growth. Intel's transformation continues and the restructuring program that we've announced in April remains on track. I'm really proud of the work our employees are doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard, and going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed, and resilient this team is. And finally, I'd like to welcome Bob to the Company as our Chief Financial Officer. He brings a wealth of leadership experience to Intel, and his financial acumen and strategic insights will be an asset to the Company. At the same time, I'd like to thank Stacy for an outstanding nine years as CFO. He's been a great partner, and I'm excited to have his leadership in manufacturing, sales, and operations moving forward. Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with our results in the third quarter. We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials, and continued to realign our resources to our strategy. The progress we're making leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.\n",

Great. Very helpful. My follow-up, can you speak directly to how you're thinking about cycle time improvements on EUV? And as part of that, what will it take to get the ability for you to have double-digit shipments on a quarterly basis, which it looks like you need to do to hit that 35-unit forecast? And I guess as part of that, should we be thinking about the potential for customers to expedite again in the coming quarters and therefore, perhaps maybe revenue on 1 or 2 tools gets delayed into '21?\n",

      "### Text:  Peter T. F. M. Wennink,  ASML Holding N.V. - Chairman of the Management Board, President & CEO    [31]  Yes. No, I fully understand your question, Mehdi, because we always say, well, we have very long lead times in the supply chain, which is true for the critical suppliers like, for instance, ZEISS. We have, in the end, if you take Tier 2 also thousands of suppliers, which some of them have lead times which are a lot shorter. We've had delays in EUV in Q1 of a couple of weeks because one particular supplier couldn't provide rings, your flow rings, which is not the most advanced part that we need. But if you don't have it, you don't have it. So this is where our concern comes from. It's the tiered supply chain, which is not always that visible to us.  We have tiered suppliers coming from Malaysia, Mexico, you name it, and they are supplying to our Tier 2 and Tier 1 suppliers. And if that supply basically stops then even a part that has a relatively short lead time doesn't arrive on time, and we get a delay. I think, ultimately, we get those parts, it's just a delay. And if we tell you, if we give you a number and we get a significant delay in some of those short lead-time parts, we cannot ship tools and that can be significant. You may remember that the 3400C now is EUR 130 million tool. That's a big number. And I don't want to give you a range from x billion to y billion. That doesn't make sense, yes? So this is where it comes from, yes?  And I think it is really based on the experience that we've had in Q1 where we were able to manage it, but we did see some delays. And since we cannot judge what the impact will be of these governmental orders in different parts of the world, we cannot assess what that risk is. But it's there because we've seen it. We've been able to manage it with a lot of creativity. It doesn't give me any assurance or certainty that we will be able to manage it going forward always. So this is where it comes from.\n",

So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product. So it will be  it is in there in terms of the bookings. Now split between DRAM and NAND is very difficult for the simple reason that customers are continuously assessing how to allocate their lithography capabilities and their capacity between DRAM and between NAND, and there are a lot of relocations going on between DRAM and NAND.

But one of the advantages of carrying the inventory we're carrying, 64-layer and 96-layer inventory in the next year is that it has a very good cost structure, and so we should have a good cost structure in 2020 on NAND as well. The other thing, on utilization, just  I just want to make sure it's clear what period cost means is we will take that expense kind of as it comes in the quarters in which we take the underutilization. It won't roll up into inventory. It won't be counted as part of the cost. So obviously, it will have an impact on margins.

When you think about our gross margins, just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs. We benefited from that with a higher gross margin as we filled and completed that. You've seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We're not here to be able to forecast, generally, when those pricing of those components will stabilize.

There's a lot of platforms to launch here in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. We'd like to get through some of that. But we feel that the target is the right target.

      "### Text: Yes, Stacy. I think your question is about the market, and our market share is still relatively low. So our exposure with EPYC is there's a lot of activity, so there's a significant amount of activity with customers, both in all segments, cloud and enterprise. Although I wouldn't say that, that's necessarily a market trend. I would say that's sort of where we are with our EPYC qualifications and ramp. And so we don't see  for example, we don't see that Q4 was especially strong, and there will be a drop-off in Q1. In fact, we expect that EPYC should grow as we go through Q1 and the rest of 2018.\n",

I mean if you look overall when we have a higher mix of semicustom business, typically the gross margin is lower since the business model on the semicustom side has for the lower margin just the way the model is constructed. So keeping it flat at 31% with the guide in Q3 was variable in Q2. We were pretty pleased with that. And I think you're seeing some of the strength underlying the non-semicustom business is allowing us to keep it flat quarter-on-quarter.\n",

And in Q3, you're right that the decline in semi-custom, there is benefit to the margin. And the margin guide for Q3, that's approximately 43%. I can tell you that the richer product mix, especially with the new products ramping in Q3, are going to drive the gross margin. Although there is a benefit from the decline of semi-custom also, the margin benefit is more weighted towards the non-semi-custom business, and that's where we end up with the 43% in Q3. We've also updated our guidance for 2019 and now are projecting 42% for the year 2019.\n",

Amy, just a general sort of corporate-wide question on gross margins. Your revenue and COGS guide, if I ran the math correctly, imply about 60% gross margins for the December quarter. So that's going to be down year-over-year and I suspect below some of the street estimates, but it sounds like your tone is a little bit better for gross margins for the full year. So I just want to make sure I leave the call understanding what's happening here is the conclusion that 2Q is somewhat of a one-off, given the uptick in lower-margin hardware and thereafter will return to a more normal year-over-year pattern on gross margins.\n",

But again, we are very, very encouraged with what we're seeing with the current portfolio of innovation certainly in the Switching portfolio. Both the Data Center side and the Campus side are pacing well. And again, we are going to keep executing through, and we'll see how that goes.

But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter. We think it was a  Q4, in particular, was a great quarter for customers. The retail, a lot of strength in the retail part of the businesses. The teams here had done a great job planning, preparing and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continue to deliver for customers. We had a great re:Invent conference in the quarter.

      "### Text:  Kelly A. Kramer,  Cisco Systems, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO    [4]  Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter, followed by a discussion of the impact of tax reform and then end with Q3 guidance. Q2 was a strong quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We executed well in a number of areas, including good orders momentum, solid revenue growth and strong margins and cash flow. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, up 3%. Non-GAAP net income was $3.1 billion, up 10%; and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. Operating cash flow grew 8% to $4.1 billion, with free cash flow up 10%. We continue to focus on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin rate to 31.7%, up 0.7 points. Let me provide more detail on our Q2 revenue. Total product revenue was up 3%. Infrastructure platforms returned to growth, up 2%, with broad strength across the businesses. Within Switching, we had strong growth in data center switching, and we're seeing great momentum with our new campus switch, the Cat 9K. We also had strong Wireless growth, driven by our Wave 2 offerings and Meraki. Data Center was up double digits, driven by server products as well as our HyperFlex offerings. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in our routing products, driven by continued weakness in Service Provider. Let's move on to applications. Applications is made up of our collaboration portfolio of Unified Communications, conferencing and TelePresence; as well as our IoT and application software businesses, Jasper and AppDynamics. Applications was up 6% in total, with strength in TelePresence and conferencing as well as AppDynamics, offset by some weakness in UC endpoints. There was also a strong increase in deferred revenue, up 18%. Security was up 6%, with strong performance in unified threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 38% as we continue to drive more subscription-based software offers. Service revenue was up 3%, driven by growth in software and solutions support. We continue to transform our business, delivering more software offerings and driving more subscriptions and recurring revenues. In Q2, we generated 33% of our total revenue from recurring offers, an increase of 2 points from a year ago. Revenue from subscriptions was 52% of our software revenue. We drove good growth in deferred revenue, which was up 10% in total, with product up 19% and services up 4%. Deferred revenue, product revenue from our recurring software and subscription offers was $5.5 billion, up 36%. We saw strong momentum in Q2 product orders, growing 5% in total. Looking in our geographies, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 6% and APJC was flat. Total emerging markets was up 1%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 1%. In our customer segments, enterprise was up 3%, commercial grew 14%, public sector was up 8% and service provider declined 5%. From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total Q2 growth margin was 64.7%, up 0.6 points. Product gross margin was 63.3%, up 0.9 points. And service gross margin was 68.5%, down 0.3 points. We continue to be negatively impacted by the higher memory pricing we have discussed over the past several calls, which we expect to continue in the near term. Our operating margin was 31.7%, up 0.7 points. When we look at the impact of acquisitions on our results year-over-year, there's been an 80 basis point positive impact on revenue and a negative $0.01 year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP EPS. In terms of the bottom line, our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.63, up 11%. GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.78, driven by the onetime charges related to U.S. tax reform. We're very pleased with the tax rate reduction related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Since our fiscal year ends in July, we won't realize a full benefit this year but will start  and we will start to realize that full year's worth in fiscal year '19. For Q2, our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% to adjust to our full year estimated non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. We are currently forecasting our estimated non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year '19 to be 20%. This quarter, we incurred an $11.1 billion charge to our income tax provision that is comprised of $9 billion related to the U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $0.9 billion for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets related with the lower tax rate. Our Q2 GAAP tax rate includes the impact of this charge while our non-GAAP rate excludes it. We ended Q2 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $73.7 billion, with $2.4 billion available in the U.S. We plan on repatriating $67 billion of our offshore funds to the U.S. in Q3 of fiscal year '18. Q2 operating cash flow of $4.1 billion reflects strong growth of 8%. Free cash flow was also very strong with growth of 10% to $3.9 billion. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders during the quarter that included $4 billion of share repurchases and $1.4 billion for our quarterly dividend. Today, we announced a $0.04 increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share, up 14% year-over-year. This represents a yield of approximately 3.1% based on today's closing price. We also announced a $25 billion increase to the authorization of the share repurchase program. This raises the remaining share repurchase authorization to approximately $31 billion. We expect to utilize this over the next 18 to 24 months. This significant dividend increase and additional share repurchase authorization reinforces our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders and our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter with solid top line growth, strong profitability, cash flows and order growth. We continue to make solid progress on our strategic priorities, making key investments to drive our long-term growth. Let me reiterate our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year '18. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We closed the acquisition of BroadSoft in early Q3, and the impact of the acquisition is factored into our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5%. And the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.64 to $0.66. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&A.\n",

But keep in mind, we're still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It's ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than 1/4 of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow.  We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy.

So like we anticipated, as we are so rapidly ramping the Cat 9K and as we are blowing out DNA across not only that, but also our Viptela offerings and across wireless, the revenue headwind was getting more closer to 2.5 to 3 points. Now the good news on this is with the new revenue standard going forward, because it's accelerating some of these offers that we did have previously defer, that headwind will become less of a headwind, okay? So as opposed to the 2.5 to 3 under current accounting standards, that will be much less, closer to like 1.5 point or so, if I had to guess roughly. And again, this will all flush out as we go through it, but it will become less of a headwind because we have such a big portion of things that we will now be recognizing upfront.\n",

Because it is not only whether you use 6 or you use 10 layers, but it's also what is the wafer capacity that you are going to build. So I think it is  there is some changes back and forth, up and down, which is driven more by how much wafer capacity do they want to build. That has less to do with the technology but more with the end demand. And that is still above our capacity  build capacity.\n",

And I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street as well as just general go-to-market around commercial. Starting with Ryzen, I think you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger, and it's not just the number of platforms but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well. What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is the stronger part of the PC market. And we'll continue to talk about that.  As it relates to new platforms, certainly as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think you'll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We're investing heavily in security and manageability and all of those other aspects that are important in the commercial space. As it relates to EPYC in the Enterprise, I'm actually very encouraged with what we see in the Enterprise. We had originally said that we thought we would be more cloud  sort of cloud would go first and then Enterprise would take longer. I think what we currently see is cloud is certainly a big driver of our business. But our Enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I really would say that the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly. We have had a number of engagements, and I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in Enterprise across our top OEMs has increased very significantly just in the last sort of 2 months since we launched. So the awareness around EPYC as well as the awareness around these new platforms, I think, is strong, and we'll continue to build that out as we go forward.\n",

And as you've seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we're still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It's ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than 1/4 of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow.  We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3.\n",

When you think about our gross margins, just over this last quarter, as you know, we were working on stabilizing the overall supply that was out there in the market for consumer GPUs. We benefited from that with a higher gross margin as we filled and completed that. You've seen us absorb a significant amount of the component pricing changes that we have seen, particularly around the memory. We're not here to be able to forecast, generally, when those pricing of those components will stabilize. But we believe in terms of the value added that our platforms provide, the components are an important part of finishing that. But I think we have a tremendous amount more value that we are adding in terms of the software on top of our platforms, which is enabling our gross margins.\n",

There are lots of those segments that are value-add where you have to have long-term customer relationships where there's a certain amount of trust, and I think from Micron's perspective, that's actually an advantage for us. Our customers like us. They want us to succeed. We have a long-term history of meeting our commitments, and so I think in this kind of environment that actually plays out pretty well for us.  Some of the specific segments that are value-add that are pretty important, things like graphics, we grew our graphics business pretty substantially this year. In many cases, those are sole source relationships, or two sources at most, and a significant piece of the customer's end product and so those types of relationships, I think, are flagships for that kind of thought process.

It could be EUV not as effective as we then, at that moment in time, planned or whether markets were different. And you can actually conclude from those scenarios that higher EUV will lead to somewhat lower immersion, but still significant. And it's logical because it will cannibalize some of the multiple patterning layers. On the other hand also, layers are growing, yes? So it also  so basically, there is a dilutive effect in that sense that you have more layers, and some of those layers will be deep UV layers, will be the immersion layers. So no matter how you look at it, the number of EUV and of immersion systems will still remain significant, also with high EUV introduction.

And you inspect the photomask with e-beam preferably, and then you can do the correction. So masks, I think we have all the solutions that we can think of for the 7-nanometer introduction. Photoresist actually makes some good progress, and especially on the sensitivity side. I mean, we're seeing continuous numbers coming back out of the industry and industry participants on sensitivity of the photoresist, which is good, because the more sensitive the photoresist is, the faster you can move the wafer, the higher the throughput.

Because if you looked at the way we sold the switch previously, as an example, we would sell a switch with integrated software one time, and perhaps, 5 to 7 years later, we'd go in and try to sell another one. In this model, the underlying ability for us to go in at either the 3-year, the 5-year point, whenever that subscription is up, and renew it, that still exists. This is just an accounting change.

We had it at about 15% of total YouTube revenue. And then how is the faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long-term profitability goals at YouTube? And then the second question is on Search. So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year-on-year is pretty encouraging. If we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre-COVID levels in those areas?\n",

So I think you laid out the kind of EUV puts and takes, but also you said the lengths of the 10 nanometer and then 7 nanometer nodes and I think you also just said that you expect that to continue into next year. I think TSMC raised CapEx, they also said they have more customer interest at 7 nanometer than they had previously expected. So I guess my question is how conservative is the implied revenue run rate, which I believe is around EUR1.6 billion for Q4, as you see things right now? And then my second question was on EUV, you have a backlog of 10 tools now. Could you just kindly let us know how many customers make up those 10 tools? And also what is the magnitude of potential further orders in the second half of this year or will 2017 be a meaningfully bigger year potentially for EUV orders just so we know what to look for? Thank you.\n",

But do you see TSMC and the foundry market coming back in the following year as they begin to add more capacity in 2021? And what do you think is going to be your long-term capacity for EUV tools post this 2020, which is the big initial ramp up of EUV? And then secondly, when we  Roger, my question to you on the gross margin. Can you just  in your opening remarks, you said that your gross margin in the fourth quarter is going to be higher than 50%?

You'll have more in the next couple of quarters. So next year, like 20, 22 is also probably what we are going to see. And at the same time, I heard also that the DUV business is likely to do well in 2018 as well because, mostly because of China generating like a new area of demand in DUV. And when I look at consensus expectations, basically if I assume there is about like $2 billion of EUV revenues  sorry, EUR 2 billion of EUV revenues with about 20 tools, then that implies the DUV business would be down about $1 billion in 2018. Do you think that kind of pullback makes sense and would reflect maybe like a sustaining of the rollout of the 10-nanometer node? Or do you think actually to 28 and could be another very strong year in DUV?\n",

So they will take those tools and will use those tools to create a first line where they can qualify their product. So it will be  it is in there in terms of the bookings.

What we did experience last year was a gangbuster year, but it's been 3 quarters coming into the third quarter where they went through digestions. And what we started to see in the third quarter was, particularly for high-performance compute, start to see them come back into the market to really begin to purchase a little bit more. So how long that cycle lasts is going to be a function of several variables, but their end demand seems to continue to be relatively strong. And therefore, the need to add capacity, we think, will follow their end demand given they've been out of the market a little bit for about 3 quarters now up 'til Q3.\n",

Really, it has been, and is that transactional component. You're right, we continue to see the annuity growth. We continue see the growth through Azure, and the offset to that has been the transactional business. I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason, other than  that's changed my world view, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tends to exert itself on that transactional business. But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continuing to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change, outside of that component we discussed. In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the intelligent cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business. It's still less than 20%, but that 20%, right, lends itself in quarter to the volatility you see. The productivity and business process segment has a bit more transactional exposure, just because it has both the consumer and commercial office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs.

So if I look at the cloud CapEx, they were up about 70%. If I look at the CPU going into the cloud, according to Intel, it was up about 60%. So I was wondering how much you guys have been increasing revenues within your cloud business? Did you grow faster than CPUs? Did you grow faster than the overall CapEx? And then I have a follow-up in 2020.\n",

      "### Text:  Colette M. Kress,  NVIDIA Corporation - Executive VP & CFO    [11]  Yes. Let me see if I can answer this one for you. Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center. And as you've seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we're still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It's ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than 1/4 of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow.  We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3.\n",

      "### Text:  Brian Krzanich,  Intel Corporation - CEO    [3]  Thanks, Mark. Q3 was an outstanding quarter, which produced records in a number of product lines, and serves as evidence of our transformation to a Company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected devices. As a great proof point, third-quarter revenue grew 9% over last year to an all-time record of $15.8 billion on broad-based strength across our businesses. I'd like to take a minute to share a few of the highlights with you now. I'll start with the client computing group, which had a stellar quarter. This team's focus on delivering an annual cadence of innovative new products, improving product costs, and driving operational efficiencies contributed to a remarkable 37% growth in CCG operating margins. The client computing group's revenue grew 5% over last year, but just as importantly, DCG is playing in a direct and impactful role in our transformation. In the data center group, revenue grew 10% year over year to a record $4.5 billion. We saw the growth segments of the data center group accelerating at a rate above our forecast. The cloud service provider segment was up 32%. In the [com] service provider segment, we continued to grow at a faster rate than the market, 16% growth, as the market converts to NFE and SDN and demand for our products increase. In addition, non-CPU adjacencies across DCG grew an impressive 34%. This category includes our new omni-path high-performance fabric, which is leading in performance and gaining design-win momentum. It includes our Silicon Photonics and our Xeon Phi, all of which began their ramps this year. However, enterprise revenue was down 3%, trending below our expectations of a roughly flat year over year. As a result, DCG revenue growth for the full year will likely be in the high single digits. Another key growth opportunity for Intel, our Internet of Things business, grew 19% over last year, setting an all-time revenue record of nearly $700 million. We saw strength across the board in retail, video, and transportation segments. Revenue in our memory business was approximately flat year over year. 3D NAND production at the Dalian factory is ramping ahead of schedule, with yields matching those of our other production facilities. We continue to see industry enthusiasm building for our ground-breaking new memory technology, 3D Crosspoint, and we're making steady progress toward bringing it into production. Intel's programmable solutions group, formerly Altera, was up 6% on strength in wireline, industrial, and broadcast segments. I'm very pleased with the integration of Altera into Intel. We continued to execute against our [deal thesis], and PSG has produced three consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth compared to Altera's results after adjusting for acquisition-related accounting charges. In the third quarter, we began sampling our Stratix 10 product, Intel's first FPGA produced on our own process technology, and also, the industry's first and only 14-nanometer FPGA. We are shipping our first co-packaged parts for the data center and are continuing to see opportunities for design wins with PSG products across many of Intel's businesses. PSG's results show the tremendous progress and execution. The Intel security business was up 6% over last year. Last month we announced that we will sell 51% of Intel security to private equity firm TPG, and establish a jointly-owned, independent cybersecurity Company named McAfee. This transaction will position McAfee to invest as an independent Company while allowing Intel to continue to participate in McAfee's success and growth. Intel's transformation continues and the restructuring program that we've announced in April remains on track. I'm really proud of the work our employees are doing to accelerate our strategy. A change of this magnitude is hard, and going through it has again reinforced just how talented, committed, and resilient this team is. And finally, I'd like to welcome Bob to the Company as our Chief Financial Officer. He brings a wealth of leadership experience to Intel, and his financial acumen and strategic insights will be an asset to the Company. At the same time, I'd like to thank Stacy for an outstanding nine years as CFO. He's been a great partner, and I'm excited to have his leadership in manufacturing, sales, and operations moving forward. Wrapping things up, I'm very pleased with our results in the third quarter. We introduced exciting new products, delivered strong financials, and continued to realign our resources to our strategy. The progress we're making leaves me increasingly confident in our transformation. With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.\n",

But it's a good sign that it's building, an important step was that global Prime program that we launched in the fall, excuse me, in Q4. As I said, it's very much a fixed expense game, especially with original content. The fixed amount can go up or down, but the ability to amortize it over large population is what we are looking for. So we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again, both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people. Because we think it's done really well. We think it's won a lot of awards, and we have worked with some great talented people.

We've extended that and begun to extend it to the PC. We're extending it to mobile. That platform strength will drive this more annuity-like behavior that you're thinking about, which is great. And we saw that in the Game Pass subscription growth again this quarter, building on that base. But then the third-party titles will drive some volatility, but that volatility is just reinforcing of the position we have and I think the long relationship with fans.

Schools have a duty to provide a safe environment for students. You can request the surveillance footage formally through a written request; if the school refuses, this may be something that can be compelled through legal means. Document all interactions with the school regarding this issue. It would be prudent to consult with an attorney who handles education law to explore the possibility of a lawsuit for failing to provide a safe environment for your child. They can guide you on how to proceed with obtaining evidence and how to protect your son's rights. Ensure that your son's experiences are also recorded, as his account may be crucial for any legal action.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In Tennessee, educators are expected to uphold ethical standards and avoid any appearance of impropriety. Selling items, even for a good cause, directly to students during school hours could raise ethical concerns and possibly be seen as taking advantage of the teacher-student relationship. If the fundraiser isn't school-sponsored, the educator may not be allowed to sell items on school property without proper permission. Additionally, many schools have policies in place about fundraising or selling items on campus, especially when it involves food, due to federal and state guidelines about nutrition in schools. Before proceeding with any sales, the educator should consult with the school administration and familiarize themselves with the school and district policies. For personalized legal advice tailored to your unique circumstances, it's advisable to consult with an attorney.\n",

Another man I want my common law husband's survivors benefits social sec says no because we never divorced we had a child so am I eligible or am I a bigamist \n",
      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In Georgia, if you were in a common law marriage before the state ceased recognizing such unions in 1997 and never legally dissolved it, that marriage may still be considered valid. Entering into a legal marriage with another person while still in a valid common law marriage could potentially be viewed as bigamy, which is illegal. This situation complicates your eligibility for survivor benefits from your common law spouse. Social Security typically requires that the marriage be legally valid and not terminated by divorce to qualify for survivor benefits. If your common law marriage was never legally ended, it may impact your marital status and the legitimacy of your subsequent marriage. It's important to consult with a legal professional experienced in family law to clarify your marital status and understand your rights regarding survivor benefits. They can offer specific advice based on the details of your case. Addressing this issue promptly can help resolve any legal complications and determine your eligibility for benefits.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:When choosing a name for your dog rescue, it's important to consider trademark laws to avoid legal issues. The term \"Batgirl\" is a well-known trademark associated with DC Comics, and using it in your business name without permission could lead to trademark infringement issues. Before finalizing the name \"Tracy Batgirls Dog Rescue,\" you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it doesn't infringe on existing trademarks. This search can be done through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database. If the name is potentially infringing, it's advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. Obtaining permission would involve contacting DC Comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. If you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. This could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. In summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it's crucial to ensure that the name you choose does not violate trademark laws. Consulting with an attorney experienced in intellectual property law can provide you with guidance and help safeguard your rescue from potential legal complications.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If you had two permits allowing for the cultivation of up to 99 plants each but were found cultivating 325 plants, you exceeded the allowable amount by 127 plants. This excess could be the reason for your misdemeanor charge and the associated fines. The confiscation of all plants, including those within the permitted limit, may raise legal questions about whether the seizure was excessive. To address the lien on your property, it's critical to ensure that the settled amount of $16,000 is paid timely, and upon payment, ensure that the lien is properly released. It's also essential to maintain all documentation relating to your permits, the cultivation, the charges, and the settlement. If you believe there were irregularities in how your case was handled, or if you want to challenge the actions taken against you, consider taking legal action or seeking a review of your case. It's advisable to consult with fellow attorneys knowledgeable about California's cannabis laws to understand your rights and potential remedies.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If you believe a false CPS (Child Protective Services) claim was made against you, there are steps you can take to address the situation. First, cooperate fully with the CPS investigation. It's important to demonstrate your willingness to ensure the safety and well-being of your children, which is the primary concern of CPS. You can also document your interactions with CPS and gather any evidence that supports your position that the claim is false. This might include witness statements, records, or other relevant information. After the investigation, if you feel that the claim was maliciously false, you can consider legal action against the person who made the report. In South Carolina, making a false report to CPS can be considered a criminal offense and may also open the door to a civil lawsuit for defamation. However, keep in mind that CPS reports are confidential and there are legal protections for reporters to encourage the reporting of potential child abuse or neglect. Legal action based on a false report can be complex and challenging. Consulting with an attorney can provide you with specific advice on how to proceed. An attorney can help you understand your rights, the legal implications of the CPS report, and the potential for taking action against the person who filed the report.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If someone has taken your dog without your consent and is claiming ownership, you should initially attempt to resolve the situation through communication. Share your side of the story and your attachment to the dog. Gathering evidence such as photographs, veterinary records, or any documentation of your responsibilities for the dog can strengthen your case. If communication fails, contact your local animal control or law enforcement agency to report the situation, as they may be able to mediate or provide guidance. Consulting an attorney who specializes in property or animal law is advisable if disputes persist. In extreme cases, a civil lawsuit may be necessary to establish your ownership rights.

      " A:Certainly. If the money your children receive is from SSDI, it's intended for their care and support. If you believe your husband is misusing these funds, there are steps you can consider: 1. Document the misuse: Gather evidence showing the inappropriate spending or diversion of funds. 2. Apply to be the representative payee: The Social Security Administration (SSA) allows for another individual, usually a parent, to be designated as the representative payee to handle the funds for the child's benefit. 3. Once appointed, set up a dedicated account for these funds, ensuring that only authorized expenses related to the child's well-being are paid from this account. 4. If the situation escalates, you may need to consult with legal counsel for potential family court intervention, especially if the children's welfare is at risk. 5. Always communicate your concerns with the SSA; they have a vested interest in ensuring benefits are used appropriately. 6. Lastly, prioritize your children's best interests and consider seeking mediation or counseling to address underlying financial disputes.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In California, financial institutions are not permitted to change a beneficiary designation after the account holder's death without a legal order or clear evidence of the account holder's intent made prior to death. If they informed you of a posthumous change, that raises concerns. The purpose of a beneficiary designation is to ensure the account holder's wishes are fulfilled upon their passing. If you believe there has been an improper alteration, you may have grounds to challenge this decision. You should gather all communications and documents related to the account and the beneficiary designation. If the financial institution does not provide a satisfactory explanation or remedy, legal action might be necessary. Consulting an attorney experienced in estate and probate matters is advisable to protect your interests and ensure the proper distribution of your father's assets. Ensure you act promptly to address any potential discrepancies or unauthorized changes.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:The Texas Department of Public Safety regulates and licenses the private security industry in Texas. To become a licensed security guard in the state of Texas, you must first complete the Level II Training Course and Test. All commissioned and non-commissioned (armed and unarmed) security officers must go through this training. The training must be taken at a licensed school and taught by a licensed instructor. The “dos” and “don’ts” are adequately covered in the course material. Additional training and tests may be necessary depending upon your particular job duties. Many of these additional requirements are discussed in the basic coursework. Your employer should be able to give you more information as to the requirements for this position. Occasionally, an employer will have no clue and will depend upon you as the licensed security officer to know and follow the applicable rules. This is particularly true if you are hired as an independent contractor rather than as a true employee. Be aware that individuals can be fined for violating DPS rules.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:I cannot give you a specific recommendation, as these types of elder law matters are highly fact specific. However, you might want to look into the caregiver child exemption. Normally you cannot transfer the home within 5 years of the application for Medicaid benefits or it will result in a transfer penalty. However, if a child resided in the home with the person needing care for two years AND that child provided care that kept the person out of a nursing home, Alabama Medicaid allows the home to pass to the child without penalty. There are other exceptions to the transfer penalty rules. Another example is the disabled child exemption. If a child is \"disabled,\" then the person needing care can transfer their home to that child without penalty. Good luck to you and your family. These situations can be difficult.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:I suggest you hire a lawyer to write a \"cease and desist\" letter to your ex-friend. The lawyer will likely inform your ex-friend that publishing defamatory statements would subject your ex-friend to liability regarding any and all damages suffered by you. And that falsely accusing someone of adultery is per se defamation. Hopefully a letter will stop the defamation. Hiring a lawyer to commence and prosecute a defamation lawsuit on your behalf is an option, but likely a very expensive option.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In federal court, a plaintiff can indeed respond to a motion to strike with an opposition. This response is an opportunity to address the points raised by the defendant and argue why the complaint or summons should not be stricken. The due date for the plaintiff to respond typically depends on the specific rules of the federal court in which the case is being heard. Generally, this deadline is set by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or by a specific order from the court. It's important to check the local court rules and any relevant orders in your case to determine the exact deadline. Additionally, there are other ways to oppose a motion to strike. For instance, you might consider filing a motion for a hearing on the matter, which would allow for oral arguments. Another option is to seek permission to amend the complaint, addressing the issues raised in the motion to strike. However, the suitability of these options would depend on the specifics of your case and the court's procedures. It's always advisable to review the relevant procedural rules and consider consulting with a colleague or a mentor who has experience in similar cases for guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n",

While my friend does not legally need to take care of his brother, they keep saying that he cannot drop him off at a hospital as he will be charged for neglect.

      " A:In California, obtaining conservatorship is often the advised legal route for gaining authority to make decisions for someone who is incapacitated, but it can be a time-consuming and expensive process. If immediate intervention is required, and conservatorship isn't feasible, you might explore emergency options such as contacting Adult Protective Services for an evaluation. While dropping off an incapacitated family member at a hospital without making proper arrangements could potentially expose one to neglect charges, state agencies or social services may be able to guide you to emergency resources or temporary solutions.\n",

If the fundraiser isn't school-sponsored, the educator may not be allowed to sell items on school property without proper permission. Additionally, many schools have policies in place about fundraising or selling items on campus, especially when it involves food, due to federal and state guidelines about nutrition in schools.

      " ### Answer: A:Bees are not fish, and it is unclear why this question is being asked in the context of agricultural law and environmental law for California. The Almond Alliance vs Fish and Game Commission case likely does not involve the classification of bees as fish. As for the issue of insects having their own section in the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), it is important to note that the CESA does cover some insect species. In fact, the CESA defines a \"species\" as including \"any subspecies of fish, wildlife, or plant, and any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature.\" This definition includes both vertebrate and invertebrate species, including insects. However, it is possible that some insect species that are important for pollination, such as bees, may not be fully covered by the CESA's provisions. In that case, advocates could potentially seek to amend the law to provide additional protections for these species.\n",

There are wells on city land because the mineral owner for that property, i.e., the city, has signed an oil and gas lease that allows those wells.

      " ### Answer: A:If you are the mineral owner and the well is producing and the royalties are over the oil company's minimum for checks, you may be entitled to royalties.

      " A:If you mediated, you may have already agreed to the transfer. Hire an attorney to search the title and and see if there is an action to set aside the transfer for fraud. But 3 year SOL has run and the trustee is the one that has standing. If sister is trustee, it is presumptively fraudulent. The SOL may bar suit but you it might be tolled for fraud.

      " ### Question: Q: Can experts determine if signature was forged with 100% confidence ?. If answer to question is yes - what methods needed to ensure 100% precision of the expertise? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Determining if a signature was forged is a complex process, and experts often hesitate to declare with 100% confidence that a signature is authentic or forged. The analysis involves a detailed examination of the questioned signature against known authentic signatures, considering factors like handwriting style, pen pressure, and stroke patterns. Experts use various methods, including microscopic analysis, digital enhancements, and sometimes chemical analysis of the ink. Despite these advanced techniques, it's important to remember that handwriting analysis is not an exact science, and there is always a degree of subjectivity involved. In legal cases, while an expert's opinion on a signature's authenticity can be highly persuasive, it is typically presented as one piece of evidence among many. If you're dealing with a potential forgery, engaging an expert in handwriting analysis can provide valuable insights, but absolute certainty may not be achievable. It's advisable to consider all aspects of the case and evidence in its entirety.\n",

However, proving negligence or a breach of duty on the part of Careerbuilder or any similar platform would be crucial. Additionally, you'd have to show that the harm you suffered was a direct result of their actions or lack thereof.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In Georgia, if you were in a common law marriage before the state ceased recognizing such unions in 1997 and never legally dissolved it, that marriage may still be considered valid. Entering into a legal marriage with another person while still in a valid common law marriage could potentially be viewed as bigamy, which is illegal. This situation complicates your eligibility for survivor benefits from your common law spouse. Social Security typically requires that the marriage be legally valid and not terminated by divorce to qualify for survivor benefits. If your common law marriage was never legally ended, it may impact your marital status and the legitimacy of your subsequent marriage. It's important to consult with a legal professional experienced in family law to clarify your marital status and understand your rights regarding survivor benefits. They can offer specific advice based on the details of your case. Addressing this issue promptly can help resolve any legal complications and determine your eligibility for benefits.\n",

Prior to developing brain cancer a friend had been nursing his dying father. When his dad died the family home became his and so did the father's farm. Both properties are in the state of Michigan. Would medicaid require the sale of the farm to help with my friend's medical expenses? He's considering selling the farm which he currently rents to a local farmer for a nominal fee each year. He needs the money for a number of living expenses. \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Business (and ANY non-homestead) property such as a farm that is rented out is not considered an 'exempt' property and needs to be liquidated in order to qualify for medicaid. The PROCESS of doing that can be technical and complicated, so it is best to get local legal representation to insure it is done properly such that there won't be medicare disqualification, but yes, in general it needs to be sold and the money either held in someone else's name for at least 5 years, or the money needs to be 'accounted for' and the person applying for medicare needs to show it was used to provide necessary care since it was received.

      " ### Answer: A:When filing a USPTO TEAS form for a trademark in the context of a restaurant that provides both restaurant and catering services, Class 43 is indeed the appropriate classification. This class broadly covers services related to the provision of food and drink, which typically includes restaurants and catering. However, it's important to be as specific as possible when defining the services. Using a term ID, such as 043-165, can provide greater clarity and specificity, indicating that your client's services specifically include restaurant and catering services.

Does the change order change the lien filing deadline? We are a specialty subcontractor. Is the work remedial or final furnishing? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Unfortunately, issues like this need to be run by experienced construction counsel who can analyze the very specific facts, any applicable contract provisions, and statutory requirements. As a legal matter, as a general rule, change orders which form part of the main contract have little effect on the 90 days allowed to record the lien after the last day of furnishing to the project. Conversely, and again only as a general rule, corrective or punch list work (even if a change order is issued) does not extend the time for unpaid contractor to record the construction lien.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:When choosing a name for your dog rescue, it's important to consider trademark laws to avoid legal issues. The term \"Batgirl\" is a well-known trademark associated with DC Comics, and using it in your business name without permission could lead to trademark infringement issues. Before finalizing the name \"Tracy Batgirls Dog Rescue,\" you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it doesn't infringe on existing trademarks. This search can be done through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database. If the name is potentially infringing, it's advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. Obtaining permission would involve contacting DC Comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. If you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. This could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. In summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it's crucial to ensure that the name you choose does not violate trademark laws. Consulting with an attorney experienced in intellectual property law can provide you with guidance and help safeguard your rescue from potential legal complications.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:It is unlikely that it is incumbent on a party's insurance agent to send out an adjuster. Typically, a party's insurance agent procures insurance on their behalf from an insurance company and forwards them a copy of the insurance policy. On occasion, a party's insurance agent may help a party complete and submit a proof of loss form to an insurance company to make a claim. Sometimes an insurance company sends out an insurance adjuster to inspect a damaged motor vehicle to adjust a claim. Other times, the adjuster can adjust the claim without personally inspecting the vehicle from photographs and repair estimates submitted to them. Other times, an insurance company might deny a claim based upon a policy defense without any need to adjust the claim or inspect the damaged vehicle. It's difficult to understand how an insurance agent or insurance company's acts or omissions would cause excessive taxes, DMV suspensions, tickets, fines, and court dates.\n",

On his discharge paperwork, it stated he had a benign growth in his pancreas. As far as I know, there was no test ever performed to determine if it was benign. He went back to the hospital on January 27th with severe pain in the abdomen, and they finally did a biopsy. They discovered he had pancreatic cancer that had spread to his liver and intestines. He died on February 2nd. This happened in Knoxville, TN if that is relevant. \n",

Unauthorized access to your personal devices, such as hacking into your phone, is a violation of various federal and state laws in the U.S. Broadcasting or disseminating personal content without your consent might also infringe on your privacy rights. If you believe someone has accessed your phone without permission, it's essential to take immediate steps to secure your device and personal information. You should also gather any evidence or details of the unauthorized access. If you wish to pursue legal action, documenting the breach and any resulting damages will be crucial.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If you had two permits allowing for the cultivation of up to 99 plants each but were found cultivating 325 plants, you exceeded the allowable amount by 127 plants. This excess could be the reason for your misdemeanor charge and the associated fines. The confiscation of all plants, including those within the permitted limit, may raise legal questions about whether the seizure was excessive. To address the lien on your property, it's critical to ensure that the settled amount of $16,000 is paid timely, and upon payment, ensure that the lien is properly released. It's also essential to maintain all documentation relating to your permits, the cultivation, the charges, and the settlement. If you believe there were irregularities in how your case was handled, or if you want to challenge the actions taken against you, consider taking legal action or seeking a review of your case. It's advisable to consult with fellow attorneys knowledgeable about California's cannabis laws to understand your rights and potential remedies.

      " ### Answer: A:In the United States, the eligibility for spousal benefits through Social Security depends on several factors, including the age of both the beneficiary and their spouse. Generally, a spouse can start receiving benefits based on their partner's record at age 62. However, if they elect to receive these benefits before reaching their full retirement age, the amount will be permanently reduced. In your case, where your wife is 62 and you are receiving SSDI, she may be eligible for spousal benefits. However, it's important to note that these benefits would be reduced because she is not at full retirement age. The full retirement age varies depending on the year of birth, and for many people, it is beyond 62. The information you received about waiting until she turns 65 may be specific to your circumstances or may be a misunderstanding. It's advisable to seek clarification from the Social Security Administration or consult with a professional who has expertise in Social Security benefits.

      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If you believe a false CPS (Child Protective Services) claim was made against you, there are steps you can take to address the situation. First, cooperate fully with the CPS investigation. It's important to demonstrate your willingness to ensure the safety and well-being of your children, which is the primary concern of CPS. You can also document your interactions with CPS and gather any evidence that supports your position that the claim is false. This might include witness statements, records, or other relevant information. After the investigation, if you feel that the claim was maliciously false, you can consider legal action against the person who made the report. In South Carolina, making a false report to CPS can be considered a criminal offense and may also open the door to a civil lawsuit for defamation. However, keep in mind that CPS reports are confidential and there are legal protections for reporters to encourage the reporting of potential child abuse or neglect. Legal action based on a false report can be complex and challenging. Consulting with an attorney can provide you with specific advice on how to proceed. An attorney can help you understand your rights, the legal implications of the CPS report, and the potential for taking action against the person who filed the report.\n",

      " ### Question: Q: Hi I'm a victim of dv my boyfriend is locked up the DA want me to talk my question is what type of protection is offered. I Avoided the DA because me and my family are afraid and I have no transportation. So will they help with any of it \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Talk to the DA and see what, if anything, they are willing to do. Being afraid to talk with them, however, doesn't really make much sense given that you probably are the star witness against BF so as soon as he gets out he may come looking for you in order to stop or at least discourage you from testifying against him. The DA and restraining order(s) are you best chance of protection, along with moving somewhere that he can't find you (or that mutual friends won't tell him about).

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If someone has taken your dog without your consent and is claiming ownership, you should initially attempt to resolve the situation through communication. Share your side of the story and your attachment to the dog. Gathering evidence such as photographs, veterinary records, or any documentation of your responsibilities for the dog can strengthen your case. If communication fails, contact your local animal control or law enforcement agency to report the situation, as they may be able to mediate or provide guidance. Consulting an attorney who specializes in property or animal law is advisable if disputes persist. In extreme cases, a civil lawsuit may be necessary to establish your ownership rights. Exploring mediation can also be a more amicable way to reach an agreement.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:In the state of Alabama, there are laws that address timber trespass and unauthorized timber removal. One such law is the Alabama Timber Trespass Law, which allows landowners to seek compensation for damages resulting from unauthorized timber cutting on their property. Under this law, if someone cuts or removes timber from your property without permission, they may be held liable for the value of the timber, any damage caused, and potentially additional penalties.

      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:Certainly. If the money your children receive is from SSDI, it's intended for their care and support. If you believe your husband is misusing these funds, there are steps you can consider: 1. Document the misuse: Gather evidence showing the inappropriate spending or diversion of funds. 2. Apply to be the representative payee: The Social Security Administration (SSA) allows for another individual, usually a parent, to be designated as the representative payee to handle the funds for the child's benefit. 3. Once appointed, set up a dedicated account for these funds, ensuring that only authorized expenses related to the child's well-being are paid from this account. 4. If the situation escalates, you may need to consult with legal counsel for potential family court intervention, especially if the children's welfare is at risk. 5. Always communicate your concerns with the SSA; they have a vested interest in ensuring benefits are used appropriately. 6. Lastly, prioritize your children's best interests and consider seeking mediation or counseling to address underlying financial disputes.\n",

      " A:In California, financial institutions are not permitted to change a beneficiary designation after the account holder's death without a legal order or clear evidence of the account holder's intent made prior to death. If they informed you of a posthumous change, that raises concerns. The purpose of a beneficiary designation is to ensure the account holder's wishes are fulfilled upon their passing. If you believe there has been an improper alteration, you may have grounds to challenge this decision. You should gather all communications and documents related to the account and the beneficiary designation. If the financial institution does not provide a satisfactory explanation or remedy, legal action might be necessary. Consulting an attorney experienced in estate and probate matters is advisable to protect your interests and ensure the proper distribution of your father's assets.

To become a licensed security guard in the state of Texas, you must first complete the Level II Training Course and Test. All commissioned and non-commissioned (armed and unarmed) security officers must go through this training. The training must be taken at a licensed school and taught by a licensed instructor. The “dos” and “don’ts” are adequately covered in the course material. Additional training and tests may be necessary depending upon your particular job duties. Many of these additional requirements are discussed in the basic coursework. Your employer should be able to give you more information as to the requirements for this position. Occasionally, an employer will have no clue and will depend upon you as the licensed security officer to know and follow the applicable rules. This is particularly true if you are hired as an independent contractor rather than as a true employee. Be aware that individuals can be fined for violating DPS rules.\n",

      " A:I cannot give you a specific recommendation, as these types of elder law matters are highly fact specific. However, you might want to look into the caregiver child exemption. Normally you cannot transfer the home within 5 years of the application for Medicaid benefits or it will result in a transfer penalty. However, if a child resided in the home with the person needing care for two years AND that child provided care that kept the person out of a nursing home, Alabama Medicaid allows the home to pass to the child without penalty. There are other exceptions to the transfer penalty rules. Another example is the disabled child exemption. If a child is \"disabled,\" then the person needing care can transfer their home to that child without penalty. Good luck to you and your family. These situations can be difficult.\n",

The case is a child welfare case that I strongly believe violated my right to a fair trail in everyway possible. Seeking outside legal advice about the case. I recently submitted a application to the child abuse index and if my name was added I want to be prepared to have it removed along with personal reasons. Requested the information from the filing party and was denied no help with the other side also I tried researching myself and from what I read I would need a legal witness \"not sure if that's the correct name\" but is the correct way to address my concern? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:To find an outside legal expert to review your child welfare case, you could reach out to bar associations, which often offer attorney referral services, or consult legal directories such as Martindale-Hubbell or Avvo. If you believe your right to a fair trial was violated, an attorney experienced in child welfare and family law can evaluate the merits of your case and potentially serve as an \"expert witness\" to testify on procedural or substantive irregularities. Given that you've been denied information and have concerns about possible child abuse index listing, it's imperative to consult an attorney as soon as possible to assess your legal options and possible remedies.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:Landlords must repair health and safety issues and provide essential services under the Landlord Tenant Law. Generally, the statutes specify what you may sue for and what damages you can recover. The analysis is very situation specific. However, another option you may have is deliver a letter to the landlord stating that you intend to cancel your lease if the essential service or health and safety issue is not corrected within 14 days. However, to make sure that you follow the legal procedure to terminate your lease you should talk to a local lawyer about your situation.

      " ### Question: Q: Is the citizenship process quicker for a disabled adult vs. a normal adult?. My wife has a 23 year old disabled son (cerebral palsy and has the mental capability of a 2yr old). He still lives in Colombia with his father. If I wanted to adopt him as my son, would the citizenship process be faster than it is for a normal 23 year old adult? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:In order for an adoption to be binding on immigration authorities, the adoption must occur while the child is still under the age of 16 (along with some other requirements), therefore, if her son is already 23 years old any adoption would not be recognized for immigration purposes. But if you married his mother while he was under the age of 18, he would be considered your stepchild and you could file a petition for him as his stepparent. However, as he is already over the age of 21, he would no longer be classified as an immediate relative, which means you would have to wait for a visa to become available to him.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:It is not an antitrust matter. The HOA does not meet the requirements to be subject to antitrust laws. HOA requirements of a purchase from a particular dealer arguably have a rational basis to allow the hyper-conformity that some HOAs require (no comment on whether HOAs de facto transform home ownership into rentals via hyper-restrictive rules).

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In federal court, a plaintiff can indeed respond to a motion to strike with an opposition. This response is an opportunity to address the points raised by the defendant and argue why the complaint or summons should not be stricken. The due date for the plaintiff to respond typically depends on the specific rules of the federal court in which the case is being heard. Generally, this deadline is set by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or by a specific order from the court. It's important to check the local court rules and any relevant orders in your case to determine the exact deadline. Additionally, there are other ways to oppose a motion to strike. For instance, you might consider filing a motion for a hearing on the matter, which would allow for oral arguments. Another option is to seek permission to amend the complaint, addressing the issues raised in the motion to strike. However, the suitability of these options would depend on the specifics of your case and the court's procedures. It's always advisable to review the relevant procedural rules and consider consulting with a colleague or a mentor who has experience in similar cases for guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:You have asked a good question which should serve as a warning to all consumers: Read the contract before you sign it. I think I can guarantee that if you had complained before you signed, those add-ons would have been removed. The dealer's explanation is simply bs to lull people into accepting expensive add-ons that are very profitable for the company. I assume you financed the vehicle. Your financing agreement already includes the price of those add-ons. They are already included in the car payment can't be removed without re-doing the financing. Who provides the paint and gps protection? If it is an outside company, not the dealer, ask them to cancel the protection and rebate the cost back to you. I suggest you talk to the lender, not the dealer, to explain the situation, and see if they would agree to refinance the contract and eliminate the add-ons. Another thing you can do is go on web sites like Yelp and tell the world your story about that dealer.\n",

My friend lives on very limited amount of money, in a tiny room in an apartment. Trying to get conservatorship would take a lot of time and money.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In California, obtaining conservatorship is often the advised legal route for gaining authority to make decisions for someone who is incapacitated, but it can be a time-consuming and expensive process. If immediate intervention is required, and conservatorship isn't feasible, you might explore emergency options such as contacting Adult Protective Services for an evaluation. While dropping off an incapacitated family member at a hospital without making proper arrangements could potentially expose one to neglect charges, state agencies or social services may be able to guide you to emergency resources or temporary solutions.\n",

      " A:No, that is not always the case. There are several factors to take into account outside of the actual bodily injury aspects of the policy, which sometimes get overlooked. Some of those include: 1.) Property damage coverage for punitives if punitive conduct can be shown; 2.) Assets of the individual tortfeasor; 3.) Other potential defendants (why did this person hit you - blocked view, drunk, etc.) that may have some liability 4.) If insurance company fails to pay policy limits timely, there might be an open policy scenario where the insurance company itself is also responsible for the full extent of the harm.

      " ### Answer: A:If you believe the marketing company misrepresented the terms before you signed the contract, there may be grounds to contest it. Misrepresentation can occur when false statements or promises are made to induce someone into a contract. First, review the contract thoroughly to understand its terms and any clauses about termination or dispute resolution. Compare what is written in the contract with what you were told verbally. It's crucial to identify any specific discrepancies between the verbal promises and the written agreement. If you find significant differences, gather any evidence of these misrepresentations. This might include emails, text messages, or notes from meetings. Evidence is key in demonstrating that what was promised differs from what's in the contract. You should then consider seeking legal advice. A lawyer can provide guidance on the strength of your case and the best approach to take. They can assist in negotiating with the company or, if necessary, taking legal action to resolve the issue. Remember, every situation is unique, and the outcome can depend on the specific details of your case.

Once notified: 1. Immediate Steps: Monitor your credit reports, consider placing fraud alerts or credit freezes, and change relevant account passwords. 2. Legal Remedies: If a company's negligence leads to the breach, under the CCPA, you might have grounds for legal action. Large-scale breaches often result in class action lawsuits where affected individuals can join collectively. For personalized legal advice tailored to your unique circumstances, it's advisable to consult with an attorney.\n",

      "### Question: Q: Is legal to make hate comments?. I was in a chat whose link was published by an Instagram influencer. I got in and started talking, what happened was that one day a boy showed a picture of his pet and I told him that it was very cute and that he should bathe it well, the boy told me that he bathed it every day, I I told him that it was bad for a dog to bathe him every day, then the boy got angry with me until another one arrived (I imagine it was his friend) and they started attacking me until they wished me dead. \n",
      " ### Answer: A:In the United States, while the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, there are limits. Direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, and certain forms of hate speech can potentially be illegal. Wishing someone dead might not necessarily be construed as a direct threat, but context is crucial. If the comment was made in a way that a reasonable person would perceive as a genuine and immediate threat, there could be legal implications. Online harassment or cyberbullying can also be subject to state-specific laws. If you feel threatened or harassed, it's advisable to gather evidence of the interactions and consult with local law enforcement or an attorney. Addressing online threats and understanding the nuances requires consideration of both the specific facts and applicable laws.\n",

      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In Tennessee, educators are expected to uphold ethical standards and avoid any appearance of impropriety. Selling items, even for a good cause, directly to students during school hours could raise ethical concerns and possibly be seen as taking advantage of the teacher-student relationship. If the fundraiser isn't school-sponsored, the educator may not be allowed to sell items on school property without proper permission. Additionally, many schools have policies in place about fundraising or selling items on campus, especially when it involves food, due to federal and state guidelines about nutrition in schools. Before proceeding with any sales, the educator should consult with the school administration and familiarize themselves with the school and district policies. For personalized legal advice tailored to your unique circumstances, it's advisable to consult with an attorney.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:There is no need for your father to assume the loan.

      " ### Answer: A:In the United States, almost all male U.S. citizens and male immigrants residing in the U.S. who are 18 through 25 years old are required to register with the Selective Service System. This includes U.S. born and naturalized citizens, parolees, undocumented immigrants, legal permanent residents, asylum seekers, refugees, and all males with visas of any kind.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In Georgia, if you were in a common law marriage before the state ceased recognizing such unions in 1997 and never legally dissolved it, that marriage may still be considered valid. Entering into a legal marriage with another person while still in a valid common law marriage could potentially be viewed as bigamy, which is illegal. This situation complicates your eligibility for survivor benefits from your common law spouse. Social Security typically requires that the marriage be legally valid and not terminated by divorce to qualify for survivor benefits. If your common law marriage was never legally ended, it may impact your marital status and the legitimacy of your subsequent marriage. It's important to consult with a legal professional experienced in family law to clarify your marital status and understand your rights regarding survivor benefits. They can offer specific advice based on the details of your case. Addressing this issue promptly can help resolve any legal complications and determine your eligibility for benefits.\n",

It is recommended to seek legal advice and obtain proper licensing or permission to avoid any legal issues.

      " ### Answer: A:Hosting a paint party where participants paint the Grinch's face involves copyright considerations, as the character is protected intellectual property. If you are providing instruction and supplies for individuals to create their own paintings for personal use, it generally falls under personal enjoyment and may not infringe copyright. However, the commercial aspect of you charging for the service complicates the matter, as it could be seen as a derivative work. To ensure compliance with copyright laws, it's advisable to seek permission from the copyright holder or limit the subjects of your paint parties to non-copyrighted material.

The criminal case will be closed on January 9th with a plea deal. All of the things on her case plan has been done. They are working in family therapy \n",
      " ### Answer: A:In Nebraska, if your sister is under supervised visitation due to an ongoing criminal case and a child welfare case, the resolution of her criminal case with a plea deal could potentially impact her visitation rights. However, the child welfare case is generally treated separately from the criminal case. Once her criminal case concludes, she can petition the court overseeing her child welfare case for a reevaluation of her visitation rights. The court will consider several factors, including her compliance with the case plan, the outcome of her criminal case, and any progress made in family therapy. It's important for your sister to communicate with her attorney or legal representative regarding any changes in her situation. They can advise her on the best course of action to potentially modify her visitation arrangement. It's also crucial for her to continue complying with all requirements of the case plan and maintain her involvement in family therapy. The court will look favorably upon consistent efforts to improve her situation and strengthen her relationship with her children. The process of modifying visitation rights can be complex, and each case is unique. Therefore, it's beneficial for your sister to have ongoing legal guidance to navigate this process effectively.\n",

The custom art on the front of the card would likely be considered a derivative work, which is protected by the same copyright as the original game. Selling such custom cards without permission could infringe on the copyright holder's exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their work, and could result in legal action being taken against the seller.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:When choosing a name for your dog rescue, it's important to consider trademark laws to avoid legal issues. The term \"Batgirl\" is a well-known trademark associated with DC Comics, and using it in your business name without permission could lead to trademark infringement issues. Before finalizing the name \"Tracy Batgirls Dog Rescue,\" you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it doesn't infringe on existing trademarks. This search can be done through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database. If the name is potentially infringing, it's advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. Obtaining permission would involve contacting DC Comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. If you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. This could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. In summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it's crucial to ensure that the name you choose does not violate trademark laws. Consulting with an attorney experienced in intellectual property law can provide you with guidance and help safeguard your rescue from potential legal complications.\n",

Also I do not know what a go guideline is. If this is some type of TN child support, it has nothing to do with insurance already paid out after an obligor dies.

One exception is for the intentional physical assault by a co-worker. Then general negligence law kicks in. The employer can become civilly liable for negligent supervision/hiring if they knew about this before hand. Another question is the motivation for these co-workers to attack your son.

The father was diagnosed with a serious mental illness over a decade ago. This year the father's family had to take guardianship of him, and he was declared incompetent due to the course of his illness. Out of an abundance of caution for the safety of my kid, can I petition the court to terminate his rights or just visitation? Can this be achieved? Thank you \n",
      " ### Answer: A:In Ohio, petitioning the court to terminate a parent's rights is a serious matter and typically reserved for extreme situations. Given the father's mental illness and recent declaration of incompetence, you have valid concerns about your child's safety. You can petition the court to modify the visitation agreement. This might involve suspending or altering visitation rights rather than terminating parental rights outright. The court will consider the best interests of the child, including their safety and well-being, in making a decision. It's important to gather all relevant documentation about the father's condition and any instances where his illness may have impacted your child. This evidence will be crucial in court. Consulting with an attorney experienced in family law is advisable. They can guide you through the legal process and help you understand the implications of your actions. Remember, each case is unique, and legal advice should be tailored to your specific circumstances.\n",
      "### Question: Q: if i was referred to a company to install a grease trap but my license was expired am i in trouble. i was an apprentice with assistance from a licensed journeyman \n",
      " ### Answer: A:In Indiana, working on a project like installing a grease trap typically requires a valid license. If your license was expired at the time of the job, this could potentially be a problem, especially if licensing is a legal requirement for the work performed. However, since you mentioned you were an apprentice and had the assistance of a licensed journeyman, it's important to understand the specifics of your arrangement. If the licensed journeyman was responsible for overseeing the work and ensuring compliance with legal requirements, this may mitigate your situation. It's advisable to review the licensing requirements in Indiana for the type of work you performed. If there was a violation due to your expired license, you should consider renewing your license as soon as possible and understanding any potential legal implications of having worked with an expired license. If you're concerned about the legal ramifications, it may be wise to consult with an attorney familiar with licensing laws in your area. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances. Remember, ensuring compliance with licensing regulations is important to avoid potential legal issues and to maintain professional standards in your field. Taking steps to rectify any lapses in licensing can help protect you from possible complications in the future.\n",

Is this an offset where Sdi will consider a settlement coming in future and getting paid is it law must return it ? If istsy out of work all will be offset to ost back cause receiving an award ? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:If you collected State Disability payments for certain weeks then the Insurer PAID YOU disability for those same weeks, YOU have to pay the SDI money back to the state. If the insurer never paid you for the exact loss dates you collected SDI, then you don't have to pay back the state; it depends upon what the insurer told the EDD. Medical TREATMENT coverage only pays the treatment bills, and has nothing to do with DISABILITY payments. So if the employer is offering modified duty, accept the modified duty and insist that it pay exctly the same as the pre-injury duty pay. If the modified work pays less than your average weekly pay, you make a demand for TEMPORARY PARTIAL DISABILITY for the imissing wages; you are entitled to 2/3 of the lost wages.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If you had two permits allowing for the cultivation of up to 99 plants each but were found cultivating 325 plants, you exceeded the allowable amount by 127 plants. This excess could be the reason for your misdemeanor charge and the associated fines. The confiscation of all plants, including those within the permitted limit, may raise legal questions about whether the seizure was excessive. To address the lien on your property, it's critical to ensure that the settled amount of $16,000 is paid timely, and upon payment, ensure that the lien is properly released. It's also essential to maintain all documentation relating to your permits, the cultivation, the charges, and the settlement. If you believe there were irregularities in how your case was handled, or if you want to challenge the actions taken against you, consider taking legal action or seeking a review of your case. It's advisable to consult with fellow attorneys knowledgeable about California's cannabis laws to understand your rights and potential remedies.

Any court papers (ie claim) filed on your behalf by the lawyer will typically also contain the lawyer’s physical address, email address, and telephone number. Worse case scenario, physically go to the actual office where you signed your attorney employment agreement and ask.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:In a federal case, once the complaint and summons are filed, they can indeed be accessed through PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records). PACER is a comprehensive source for federal court documents, including filed complaints and summons. It's important to note that the documents downloaded from PACER are generally considered to be true and accurate copies of the court records. However, they may not be the \"conformed copies.\" A conformed copy is a copy of a legal document that has been stamped and endorsed to show it's a true copy of the court's original document. When it comes to serving the complaint and summons on the defendant, you should use the copies that comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the specific requirements of the court in which you're filing. This often means using copies that have the court's stamp or seal, indicating they are official documents. Remember to always check the local court rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for any specific requirements regarding the preparation and service of these documents. If there's any uncertainty, it's a good practice to reach out to the court clerk or consider consulting with peers for clarity.\n",

To my knowledge, all supervision agencies would require on-site visits for liability reasons (they don't want their employees out some place they can't really control and in what could be a volatile situation). While not ideal (it costs time, money, and let's face it: who wants to enjoy parenting time in an agency), it may be a good idea for your situation so you can show the judge a neutral and hopefully positive track record.

Typically, if someone has one or more patent(s) on a particular product, that product (or its packaging or labeling) will list the patent number somewhere (or else will identify a website that does), because the owner of the patent(s) cannot collect damages for infringement unless the infringer has notice of the patents. However, companies do not always engage in proper patent marking. However, the important question to ask is whether there are any patents that your design would infringe. There may be patents that \"cover\" a commercial product, but your modified version of that product may not infringe those patents. You need to compare your design with any pertinent patent(s).

In general, tribal police do not have inherent authority to enforce state laws on state lands unless there's a specific agreement or deputization in place. Michigan, like other states, may have agreements that allow for cross-jurisdictional activities between tribal and state law enforcement. The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. If you believe your rights were violated, you may challenge the legality of the search and any evidence obtained. Given that you're on parole, additional considerations might apply to your situation.

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If you believe a false CPS (Child Protective Services) claim was made against you, there are steps you can take to address the situation. First, cooperate fully with the CPS investigation. It's important to demonstrate your willingness to ensure the safety and well-being of your children, which is the primary concern of CPS. You can also document your interactions with CPS and gather any evidence that supports your position that the claim is false. This might include witness statements, records, or other relevant information. After the investigation, if you feel that the claim was maliciously false, you can consider legal action against the person who made the report. In South Carolina, making a false report to CPS can be considered a criminal offense and may also open the door to a civil lawsuit for defamation. However, keep in mind that CPS reports are confidential and there are legal protections for reporters to encourage the reporting of potential child abuse or neglect. Legal action based on a false report can be complex and challenging. Consulting with an attorney can provide you with specific advice on how to proceed. An attorney can help you understand your rights, the legal implications of the CPS report, and the potential for taking action against the person who filed the report.\n",

      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:If someone has taken your dog without your consent and is claiming ownership, you should initially attempt to resolve the situation through communication. Share your side of the story and your attachment to the dog. Gathering evidence such as photographs, veterinary records, or any documentation of your responsibilities for the dog can strengthen your case. If communication fails, contact your local animal control or law enforcement agency to report the situation, as they may be able to mediate or provide guidance. Consulting an attorney who specializes in property or animal law is advisable if disputes persist. In extreme cases, a civil lawsuit may be necessary to establish your ownership rights.

      "### Question: Q: Why are the lower courts operating under a maritime law when we are on land how did they have jurisdiction on land. Why is it California judicial system violates the rights under the constitution of due process when the Constitution states anything that's adverse to the Constitution is null and void? And how is it that the police department is allowed to invade your privacy punish you without proper due process rights \n",
      " ### Answer: A:California's lower courts operate under the jurisdiction and legal framework established by the United States Constitution and the California State Constitution, not maritime law. Maritime law, or admiralty law, typically applies to incidents or contracts that occur on navigable waters, and it doesn't extend to general legal matters on land. Regarding due process, the U.S. Constitution guarantees this right, and any alleged violation can be contested in the judicial system. The California judicial system is structured to comply with these constitutional provisions. If there are instances where you believe due process rights are being violated, these concerns can be addressed through legal channels such as appeals or filing appropriate motions. Police actions are also governed by constitutional protections, including the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. If you feel there has been an overreach or violation of privacy, these issues can be challenged in court. The legal system provides mechanisms for redress and correction in cases where constitutional rights are questioned.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:Certainly. If the money your children receive is from SSDI, it's intended for their care and support. If you believe your husband is misusing these funds, there are steps you can consider: 1. Document the misuse: Gather evidence showing the inappropriate spending or diversion of funds. 2. Apply to be the representative payee: The Social Security Administration (SSA) allows for another individual, usually a parent, to be designated as the representative payee to handle the funds for the child's benefit. 3. Once appointed, set up a dedicated account for these funds, ensuring that only authorized expenses related to the child's well-being are paid from this account. 4. If the situation escalates, you may need to consult with legal counsel for potential family court intervention, especially if the children's welfare is at risk. 5. Always communicate your concerns with the SSA; they have a vested interest in ensuring benefits are used appropriately. 6. Lastly, prioritize your children's best interests and consider seeking mediation or counseling to address underlying financial disputes.\n",

I am the Beneficiary for the investments my ex-wife made she passed away in2019 her executive of the will told me that she gave everything to her Granddaughter I asked for the paperwork and he told me that I was trying to dig up dirt on my ex-wife. Can he override the Beneficiary for investments \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Your divorce eliminated your name as beneficiary on investments. Investments like a mutual fund or stock are allowed to have a \"pay on death\" or a \"transfer on death\" designation. Sometimes the accounts will be in both names, with a \"right of survivorship\". The goal of those arrangement is to pass title to the investment when the primary accountholder dies, without reference to the Will and without probate. However, Section 123.151 of the Texas Estates Code states that any pay on death arrangement is \"not effective\" upon divorce, annulment, or voiding of the marriage when that arrangement was for the benefit of the former spouse or a relative of the former spouse. So, the Executor did not \"override the beneficiary\"; rather, Texas law says you are no longer beneficiary, and that the investment passes pursuant to your ex-spouse's Will, not to you.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:Ownership of a sword in your home is not specifically prohibited by any current law in the Colorado Revised Statutes. However, since a sword can be construed as a weapon or even a deadly weapon, there may be other situations that make ownership or possession of such an item illegal based off your criminal history, status, and its intended use. For example, it is routinely a condition of pre-trial release and probation to not possess any weapons, firearms or knives - a sword would most likely be considered to be a knife as the Colorado Jury Instructions define a knife as \"any dagger, dirk, knife, or stiletto with a blade over three and one-half inches in length, or any other dangerous instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds, but does not include a hunting or fishing knife carried for sports use.\" This would be a case specific determination as to whether possessing a sword in your home is prohibited based off your unique circumstances.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:In the state of Alabama, there are laws that address timber trespass and unauthorized timber removal. One such law is the Alabama Timber Trespass Law, which allows landowners to seek compensation for damages resulting from unauthorized timber cutting on their property. Under this law, if someone cuts or removes timber from your property without permission, they may be held liable for the value of the timber, any damage caused, and potentially additional penalties.

For example, there may be state or federal laws regarding deceptive advertising, unfair competition, or consumer protection that could apply.

However, I know the application is being securitized without any consideration to myself. \n",
      " ### Answer: A:In Texas, if you've been denied credit based on information from a consumer report, you should address your adverse action notice to both the bank that denied your credit and the consumer reporting agency. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) entitles you to a notice from the lender explaining the reasons for your credit denial, which includes the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting agency that provided the information. You also have the right to obtain a free copy of your credit report from the reporting agency within 60 days of receiving the denial notice. It's important to review the information in your credit report to ensure its accuracy. If there are inaccuracies, you can file a dispute with the consumer reporting agency. They are required to investigate and correct any errors. Addressing the issue with both the bank and the reporting agency ensures that you are taking comprehensive steps to address the denial of credit and any issues with your credit report. It's also advisable to document all communications and actions taken in this process.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In California, financial institutions are not permitted to change a beneficiary designation after the account holder's death without a legal order or clear evidence of the account holder's intent made prior to death. If they informed you of a posthumous change, that raises concerns. The purpose of a beneficiary designation is to ensure the account holder's wishes are fulfilled upon their passing. If you believe there has been an improper alteration, you may have grounds to challenge this decision. You should gather all communications and documents related to the account and the beneficiary designation. If the financial institution does not provide a satisfactory explanation or remedy, legal action might be necessary.

      " A:The Texas Department of Public Safety regulates and licenses the private security industry in Texas. To become a licensed security guard in the state of Texas, you must first complete the Level II Training Course and Test. All commissioned and non-commissioned (armed and unarmed) security officers must go through this training. The training must be taken at a licensed school and taught by a licensed instructor. The “dos” and “don’ts” are adequately covered in the course material. Additional training and tests may be necessary depending upon your particular job duties. Many of these additional requirements are discussed in the basic coursework. Your employer should be able to give you more information as to the requirements for this position. Occasionally, an employer will have no clue and will depend upon you as the licensed security officer to know and follow the applicable rules.

If they fail to make good on the check, you can send a formal demand for payment via certified mail. Michigan law allows you to demand payment within a certain time frame, typically seven days. If the issuer still doesn't pay, you can file a complaint with your local police department or the county prosecutor's office, as writing a bad check is a criminal offense in Michigan. Additionally, you can file a civil lawsuit to recover the amount of the check plus any additional damages allowed under Michigan law. Keep all evidence, including the check, any communication with the issuer, and records of your attempts to resolve the matter. It may also be beneficial to consult with a lawyer to guide you through the legal process and ensure that your rights are protected.\n",
      "### Question: Q: How do I prevent my husband from returning to the US with our children?. I am a US defense contractor in Germany. My husband is threatening to leave me and take our two children back to the US. We are here under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). What are my options to prevent him from taking them back to Florida? Do I need to file for divorce or is there some other method? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:I am not a family lawyer but I work on international cases. This is what I know... If the child is not present in Florida and resides abroad, Florida courts may not have jurisdiction over child custody matters under normal circumstances. Jurisdiction in child custody cases is typically determined by the child's habitual residence, which is the place where the child has been living with a present intent to make it their permanent home. In cases involving international child custody disputes, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction may come into play. The Hague Convention aims to provide a framework for the prompt return of children who have been wrongfully removed or retained across international borders. If you wish to establish a child custody arrangement and the child is living abroad, you may should seek legal recourse in the country where the child resides. This involves engaging legal counsel in Germany. Good luck.\n",

My dad and I moved in with her to be her caregivers before her health got to this point and we can’t afford to find somewhere else to live on such short notice with me being in college. \n",
      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:I cannot give you a specific recommendation, as these types of elder law matters are highly fact specific. However, you might want to look into the caregiver child exemption. Normally you cannot transfer the home within 5 years of the application for Medicaid benefits or it will result in a transfer penalty. However, if a child resided in the home with the person needing care for two years AND that child provided care that kept the person out of a nursing home, Alabama Medicaid allows the home to pass to the child without penalty. There are other exceptions to the transfer penalty rules. Another example is the disabled child exemption. If a child is \"disabled,\" then the person needing care can transfer their home to that child without penalty. Good luck to you and your family. These situations can be difficult.\n",

We want to house both products under one LLC. For one of the products we reached an agreement for distribution with a third party, but the third party wants part ownership to that software since they'll be playing a key role in how we develop and distribute it. Our first choice is to avoid creating a separate LLC for that product so would it be possible to allocate part ownership to the third party for just that sole product under our LLC? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:There are a variety of options for sharing intellectual property rights. The existence of an LLC is not necessary. You don't even have to share ownership of the existing LLC. It is easy enough to allocate profits and losses from the sale and distribution of a product in a written agreement, or to assign copyrights in whole or in part.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:A $1 buyout fee in a writer's agreement usually indicates that the music library is paying you a nominal sum for the rights to your music. Essentially, they're buying out your composition for a very small fee, which often means you may not receive future royalties from that piece. The writer's share mentioned likely refers to the percentage of royalties you retain for the performance of your music, separate from the buyout of the composition itself. This share is typically the \"pay\" you would receive when your music is performed or broadcasted. Whether a buyout fee is standard can vary widely in the industry; some libraries operate on a buyout basis, while others do not. It's important to carefully review the terms and understand how they impact your rights and future earnings from your music. If any terms are unclear or if you're unsure about the agreement's fairness, you might consider seeking advice from an attorney experienced in music law before signing.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:No because you lack standing under Missouri's wrongful death statute. Your grandson's spouse, or his children, or their children. or his mother or father can bring a lawsuit for wrongful death. If there are no such persons alive, then your grandson's brothers or sisters or their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren etc. can bring suit. In the event there are no such persons, you theoretically could ask to be appointed as a plaintiff ad litem to pursue such a case on behalf of some person entitled to share in the proceeds of such an action. This is a fail-safe for unusual situations like when there is an unborn child of your grandson gestating in a woman to whom he was not married at the time of his death. In that unusual situation, you would be bringing suit on behalf of your unborn great-grandson, not on your own behalf.\n",

Does the right of way begin when the pedestrian is standing on the corner waiting to cross or when they have stepped into the crosswalk? My question is because I received 'Pedestrian - Failure to Yield - Right of Way' ticket. In this instance the pedestrian was standing on the sidewalk, on the corner of the street and had not yet entered the crosswalk. Does the law indicate where pedestrian right of way begins? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Logically it would be when the person steps onto the road, the reality in court is generally different, thus it is when the person steps onto that pad that is right before the actual start of the road according to most judges.

      "### Question: Q: Payment in lieu of vacation. Does it count towards monthly income limit for social security disability income?. My daughter is disabled and works a part-time job. Her employer is shifting the employees to a new company and in the process is going to pay out any accrued vacation before the move. The new company is eliminating PTO for part-time workers, so it can't carry over. This will definitely put her over the $1050 monthly trial work period amount and over $1450. Any suggestions on how to address this with Social Security? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:The Social Security Administration (SSA) typically views payments in lieu of vacation as wages if they're paid because of a termination or change in employment status. These wages could impact your daughter's eligibility for Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) if they exceed the Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) limit for the month they're received. It's vital to inform the SSA about this payment promptly. Documentation regarding the nature of the payment and its relationship to the job transition can be useful. Proactively addressing the situation might help in clarifying her continuing eligibility. If there are concerns about potential overpayment or eligibility issues, discussing the specifics with an attorney familiar with Social Security matters is recommended.\n",

In some cases, will a talent manager that has ties to, let's say Atlantic Records, charge an upfront fee for their services? I'm aware it may not be common, but could it still be legit?

He talked about the what ifs, and expressed his interest, followed by sending a contract over for review. He still was interested in working regardless of our decision but told us that due to some past experiences, he charges a management fee of $350. So far we have sent him $50 to test the waters, and he doesn't seem in a rush for money.

I know this person who has the certified copies from the BLM showing ownership of land from pre-existing Spanish/Mexican land grants before California became a state in 1850 of 241,440.86 acres.

      " ### Answer: A:The heir of patent private property with allodial title on BLM records should have legal rights to the land. Allodial title is the highest form of ownership that can be held over land. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the March 3, 1851, act of Congress guaranteed the rights of Mexican citizens to their land grants in California. If the person you know has certified copies from the BLM showing ownership of land from pre-existing Spanish/Mexican land grants, then they are likely the rightful heirs to that land.

The criminal case will be closed on January 9th with a plea deal. All of the things on her case plan has been done. They are working in family therapy \n",
      " ### Answer: A:In Nebraska, if your sister is under supervised visitation due to an ongoing criminal case and a child welfare case, the resolution of her criminal case with a plea deal could potentially impact her visitation rights. However, the child welfare case is generally treated separately from the criminal case. Once her criminal case concludes, she can petition the court overseeing her child welfare case for a reevaluation of her visitation rights. The court will consider several factors, including her compliance with the case plan, the outcome of her criminal case, and any progress made in family therapy. It's important for your sister to communicate with her attorney or legal representative regarding any changes in her situation. They can advise her on the best course of action to potentially modify her visitation arrangement. It's also crucial for her to continue complying with all requirements of the case plan and maintain her involvement in family therapy. The court will look favorably upon consistent efforts to improve her situation and strengthen her relationship with her children. The process of modifying visitation rights can be complex, and each case is unique. Therefore, it's beneficial for your sister to have ongoing legal guidance to navigate this process effectively.\n",

The child support office is required to do things like enforce child support orders, among other tasks.

The child support office also has attorneys that bring cases in front of the court to ask the court to order, modify, or enforce child support. The Court is also a part of the government. It enters court orders, including child support orders. The wants of the child support office are sometimes denied by the court. For example, if a child support attorney is asking for child support to be ordered at an amount you object to, then it is up to the Court (Judge) at what amount to order the child support.

      " ### Answer: A:As a former Series 7 and 66 stockbroker I can attest to having personally \"talked up\" many different securities. Whether there is a cause of action depends on what you mean by \"talked up\". If the stock broker mispresented the issue or provided false information concerning the stock there would be grounds for a fraud claim against the broker. There may also be grounds for a claim if the stock broker related the stock back to your financial profile. For instance, if the stock broker claimed the stock offered safety and a healthy dividend in line with stated investment objectives of safety of principal and income when in reality the stock was an extremely volatile microcap, there would be claim for unsuitability. In the end it’s a fact sensitive inquiry and more information is needed on what the stockbroker expressly stated.\n",

      " ### Answer: A:In such a situation, it's important to take immediate action. First, you should report the unauthorized Facebook account to Facebook. They have specific procedures for dealing with accounts that improperly use personal images, especially those of minors. You may also want to contact local law enforcement, as using children's photos without consent can sometimes be a legal issue. Law enforcement can investigate the matter further and determine if any laws have been violated. It's advisable to review the privacy settings on your own Facebook account to ensure your children's photos are not publicly accessible in the future. This can help prevent similar incidents from occurring. Lastly, consider seeking legal advice to explore any additional actions you can take, such as a cease and desist letter to the individual, if their identity is known, or legal remedies if any laws have been breached. Your primary concern should be the safety and privacy of your children, and these steps can help address the issue.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In federal court, a plaintiff can indeed respond to a motion to strike with an opposition. This response is an opportunity to address the points raised by the defendant and argue why the complaint or summons should not be stricken. The due date for the plaintiff to respond typically depends on the specific rules of the federal court in which the case is being heard. Generally, this deadline is set by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or by a specific order from the court. It's important to check the local court rules and any relevant orders in your case to determine the exact deadline. Additionally, there are other ways to oppose a motion to strike. For instance, you might consider filing a motion for a hearing on the matter, which would allow for oral arguments. Another option is to seek permission to amend the complaint, addressing the issues raised in the motion to strike. However, the suitability of these options would depend on the specifics of your case and the court's procedures. It's always advisable to review the relevant procedural rules and consider consulting with a colleague or a mentor who has experience in similar cases for guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n",

Are they obligated to release this info if a written request was submitted to the office? Suissevale is a Home Owners Association located in Moultonborough, NH on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee. \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Voters lists are public. Go to the town office where the voter checklist is kept. In Manchester, the voters lists are in a lobby for anyone to look through. Your town may have the same setup -but they are public documents open for anyone to look through.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:Do not know what a \"farm exemption\" is. But you probably mean you want to put the land in the Greenbelt. Go to your Tax Assessor and get the form. Carefully read it, then execute and file it with the Assessor. If not approved, there is not much you can do with only 16 acres, agricultural or forestry.\n",

      "  A:Farm exemptions are a state law that allows the state to waive certain requirements for certain farm operations. The exemption is for the following:\n",

      " ### Question: Q: We bought custom furniture in April 2021. It was delivered October 19,2021. Within a week we notice a squeaky noise. Repair service came out and agreed there was a problem. Supposedly they order a part. Nothing has been done as of January 17, 2022. Can we demand a refund? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:Likely depends on the purchase agreement, company policy, as well as the status of the part that was ordered. Demanding a refund and getting a refund are two different things, and being custom furniture, your question requires a much deeper than typical contract analysis to get a closer answer. Have you made any other inquiries into the part? What is the cost of the part?\n",

      "### Question: Q: What to do with Alzheimer's brother?. The last attorney informed me that my friend should try to get conservatorship over his brother in order to then formally request a state authority to take care of him. While my friend does not legally need to take care of his brother, they keep saying that he cannot drop him off at a hospital as he will be charged for neglect. My friend lives on very limited amount of money, in a tiny room in an apartment. Trying to get conservatorship would take a lot of time and money. Is there any attorney who has a realistic answer as to what to do with a brother who has Alzheimers and who cannot take care of himself, especially as the family member himself can barely take care of his own needs. \n",
      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:In California, obtaining conservatorship is often the advised legal route for gaining authority to make decisions for someone who is incapacitated, but it can be a time-consuming and expensive process. If immediate intervention is required, and conservatorship isn't feasible, you might explore emergency options such as contacting Adult Protective Services for an evaluation. While dropping off an incapacitated family member at a hospital without making proper arrangements could potentially expose one to neglect charges, state agencies or social services may be able to guide you to emergency resources or temporary solutions.\n",

Because 1 person is stepping down, some recommend new person elected should just work to complete the term. Does new members' right to a 3-year service prevail or should staggered terms be prioritized? \n",
      " ### Answer: A:The by-laws typically control how board members serve so they would control. Usually if a member resigns mid-term then the person replacing them would only serve out the remainder of that term. Staggered terms are in the best interest of the HOA.\n",
      "### Question: Q: Amerigas keeps filling our propane tank without authorization after they found a gas leak in our home and it's not fixed. We have no contract with Amerigas and have not fixed the gas leak in our home but they have filled the tank twice now in less than a month \n",
      " ### Answer: A:I suggest that you take the following steps: Contact Amerigas and inform them that you have not authorized them to fill your propane tank, and that there is a gas leak in your home that needs to be fixed before any further propane deliveries are made. If Amerigas does not comply, you may need to contact the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and report the situation. The CPUC is responsible for regulating propane companies and ensuring that they comply with safety regulations. You may also want to consider contacting a licensed contractor to fix the gas leak in your home as soon as possible. This is important for the safety of you and your family. It is also important to ensure that any future propane deliveries are authorized by you and that the gas leak is fixed before any propane is delivered. Again, please note that the above steps are general suggestions, and you may want to consult with a legal professional for specific advice on your situation.\n",

      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL ANSWER:\n",
      " A:No, that is not always the case. There are several factors to take into account outside of the actual bodily injury aspects of the policy, which sometimes get overlooked. Some of those include: 1.) Property damage coverage for punitives if punitive conduct can be shown; 2.) Assets of the individual tortfeasor; 3.) Other potential defendants (why did this person hit you - blocked view, drunk, etc.) that may have some liability 4.) If insurance company fails to pay policy limits timely, there might be an open policy scenario where the insurance company itself is also responsible for the full extent of the harm. You should always consult with an experience personal injury and insurance lawyer before making any final decisions about your case. Any other questions, don't hesitate to reach out.\n",
