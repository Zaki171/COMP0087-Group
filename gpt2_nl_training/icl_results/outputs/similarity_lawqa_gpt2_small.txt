realistically, if you were released on a citation and do not have a criminal history it is likely that you would get probation. however, you do not want to simply plead guilty to the simple possession because it will remain on your record on background checks for a minimum of six (6) years, 1 year of probation then depending on your history you may be able to get it expunged 5 years after you complete probation. your attorney may be able to get the charge dismissed through either a pass-and-dismiss, judicial diversion, dismissal at a hearing, or some other agreement that may prevent you from being found guilty. defense attorneys across the country are litigating over whether the plain smell of weed is enough to search a vehicle. most recently, tennessee courts ruled that it is a valid search but defense attorneys anticipate a similar plain-smell search case being brought before the tennessee supreme court or possibly the u.s. supreme court.', 'a:the area of law you are flirting with is fraught with great danger; those who do not retain an experienced lawyer before stepping into the line of fire very often greatly regret doing so. advising the public on how to buy

do.', 'a:if you accidentally sent your tax refund to someone else on cash app, you may be able to request a refund of the payment. however, it will depend on a few factors, such as whether the recipient has already accepted the payment or withdrawn the funds. to request a refund on cash app, you can follow these steps: open the cash app on your mobile device. tap on the clock icon on the home screen to view your transaction history. find the transaction in question and tap on it to view the details. tap on the "..." icon in the top-right corner of the screen. tap on "refund" and follow the on-screen instructions. if the recipient has already accepted the payment or withdrawn the funds, it may not be possible to request a refund through cash app. in this case, you may want to contact the recipient directly and ask them to return the funds to you. it is also important to be cautious when sending money through mobile payment apps like cash app. always double-check the

comics, and using it in your business name without permission could lead to trademark infringement issues. before finalizing the name "tracy batgirls dog rescue," you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it doesn\'t infringe on existing trademarks. this search can be done through the united states patent and trademark office (uspto) database. if the name is potentially infringing, it\'s advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. obtaining permission would involve contacting dc comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. if you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. this could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. in summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it\'s crucial to ensure that the name you choose does

result, it may be grounds for an emtala violation. the key aspect in such cases is demonstrating that the hospital did not meet its obligation to provide an adequate screening, which is not influenced by the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. it's important to gather comprehensive evidence showing that the hospital's screening was insufficient and directly led to harm or a worsened medical condition. legal action under emtala for inadequate mse must be filed within two years of the violation. these cases can be complex, and the specifics of each situation significantly impact

with a legal professional who has experience in military law can provide clarity and guidance tailored to your situation. this is especially relevant in the navy, where regulations and policies can have nuances that are different from civilian employment law.", "a:in california, financial institutions are not permitted to change a beneficiary designation after the account holder's death without a legal order or clear evidence of the account holder's intent made prior to death. if they informed you of a posthumous change, that raises concerns. the purpose of a beneficiary designation is to ensure the account holder's wishes are fulfilled upon their passing. if you believe there has been an improper alteration, you may have grounds to challenge this decision. you should gather all communications and documents related to the account and the beneficiary designation. if the financial institution does not provide a satisfactory explanation or remedy, legal action might be necessary. consulting an attorney experienced in estate and probate matters is advisable to protect your interests and ensure the proper distribution of your father's assets. ensure you act promptly to address any potential discrepancies or unauthorized changes.", 'a:you can ask for whatever amount you like. awards of damages for mental anguish vary depending upon the facts and circumstances presented by the evidence to the jury. a decent rule of thumb for settlement purposes is no more than 1.5x the amount of your medical expenses for whatever bodily injuries were caused to you as a result of whatever was wrong with the truck that is the responsibility of the defendant. but again, it is very situational. if the truck broke down on a busy highway causing your injuries and other cars were zooming past all around you, you would probably get more damages for mental anguish than if it happened in your driveway or on a quiet neighborhood street', 'a:the texas department of public safety regulates and licenses the private security industry in texas. to become a licensed security guard in the state of texas, you must first complete the level ii training course and test. all

and “don’ts” are adequately covered in the course material. additional training and tests may be necessary depending upon your particular job duties. many of these additional requirements are discussed in the basic coursework. your employer should be able to give you more information as to the requirements for this position. occasionally, an employer will have no clue and will depend upon you as the licensed security officer to know and follow the applicable rules. this is particularly true if you are hired as an independent contractor rather than as a true employee. be aware that individuals can be fined for violating dps rules.', "a:under california law, if you have entered into a lump sum contract with a hud or rd rider limiting the general contractor's (gc) profit to 14%, but suspect they are making more, you have certain rights to review documentation. the lump sum based on unit price should have clear, itemized components, which allows for transparency in billing and cost allocation. as a party to the contract, you can request backup documentation, such as subcontractor agreements, to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and the profit cap. this is a reasonable request, especially in scenarios where there's a discrepancy or suspicion of overcharging. keep in mind that the gc is obliged to adhere to the contract terms, including the profit cap. if there's evidence of non-compliance, you may have grounds for legal action. it's advisable to review the contract details and, if necessary, seek guidance on the specific procedures and legal recourses available in such situations. remember, the integrity of the contractual agreement is paramount, and both parties must uphold their end of the bargain.", 'a:i cannot give you a specific recommendation, as these types of elder law matters are highly fact specific. however, you might want to look into the caregiver child exemption. normally you cannot transfer the home within 5 years of the application for medicaid benefits or it will result in a transfer penalty. however, if a child resided in the home with the person needing care for two years and that child provided care that kept the person out of a nursing home, alabama medicaid allows the home to pass to the child without penalty. there are other exceptions to the transfer penalty rules. another example is the disabled child exemption. if a child is "disabled," then the person needing care can transfer their home to that child without penalty. good luck to you and your family. these situations can be difficult.',

realistically, if you were released on a citation and do not have a criminal history it is likely that you would get probation. however, you do not want to simply plead guilty to the simple possession because it will remain on your record on background checks for a minimum of six (6) years, 1 year of probation then depending on your history you may be able to get it expunged 5 years after you complete probation. your attorney may be able to get the charge dismissed through either a pass-and-dismiss, judicial diversion, dismissal at a hearing, or some other agreement that may prevent you from being found guilty. defense attorneys across the country are litigating over whether the plain smell of weed is enough to search a vehicle. most recently, tennessee courts ruled that it is a

to ensure it doesn\'t infringe on existing trademarks. this search can be done through the united states patent and trademark office (uspto) database. if the name is potentially infringing, it\'s advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. obtaining permission would involve contacting dc comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. if you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. this could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. in summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it\'s crucial to ensure that the name you choose does

state ceased recognizing such unions in 1997 and never legally dissolved it, that marriage may still be considered valid. entering into a legal marriage with another person while still in a valid common law marriage could potentially be viewed as bigamy, which is illegal. this situation complicates your eligibility for survivor benefits from your common law spouse. social security typically requires that the marriage be legally valid and not terminated by divorce to qualify for survivor benefits. if your common law marriage was never legally ended, it may impact your marital status and the legitimacy of your subsequent marriage. it's important to consult with a legal professional experienced in family law to clarify your marital status and understand your rights regarding survivor benefits. they can offer specific advice based on the details of your case. addressing this issue promptly can help resolve any legal complications and determine your eligibility for benefits.\n###
