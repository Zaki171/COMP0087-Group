 * semantic search allows for contextual understanding of queries \n  * semantic search can also be used to better organize content and improve linking for seo purposes\n  * if users are searching for "apple music" instead of "itunes music" it is the semantic search engines ability to determine that apple music does exist on the itunes store which makes the search useful\n  * semantic search will
