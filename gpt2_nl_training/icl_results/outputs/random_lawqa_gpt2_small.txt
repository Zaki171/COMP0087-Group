realistically, if you were released on a citation and do not have a criminal history it is likely that you would get probation. however, you do not want to simply plead guilty to the simple possession because it will remain on your record on background checks for a minimum of six (6) years, 1 year of probation then depending on your history you may be able to get it expunged 5 years after you complete probation. your attorney may be able to get the charge dismissed through either a pass-and-dismiss, judicial diversion, dismissal at a hearing, or some other agreement that may prevent you from being found guilty. defense attorneys across the country are litigating over whether the plain smell of weed is enough to search a vehicle. most recently, tennessee courts ruled that it is a valid search but defense attorneys anticipate a similar plain-smell search case being brought before the tennessee supreme court or possibly the u.s. supreme court.', 'a:the area of law you are flirting with is fraught with great danger; those who do not retain an experienced lawyer before stepping into the line of fire very often greatly regret doing so. advising the public on how to buy

do.', 'a:if you accidentally sent your tax refund to someone else on cash app, you may be able to request a refund of the payment. however, it will depend on a few factors, such as whether the recipient has already accepted the payment or withdrawn the funds. to request a refund on cash app, you can follow these steps: open the cash app on your mobile device. tap on the clock icon on the home screen to view your transaction history. find the transaction in question and tap on it to view the details. tap on the "..." icon in the top-right corner of the screen. tap on "refund" and follow the on-screen instructions. if the recipient has already accepted the payment or withdrawn the funds, it may not be possible to request a refund through cash app. in this case, you may want to contact the recipient directly and ask them to return the funds to you. it is also important to be cautious when sending money through mobile payment apps like cash app. always double-check the

comics, and using it in your business name without permission could lead to trademark infringement issues. before finalizing the name "tracy batgirls dog rescue," you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it doesn\'t infringe on existing trademarks. this search can be done through the united states patent and trademark office (uspto) database. if the name is potentially infringing, it\'s advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. obtaining permission would involve contacting dc comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. if you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. this could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. in summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it\'s crucial to ensure that the name you choose does

result, it may be grounds for an emtala violation. the key aspect in such cases is demonstrating that the hospital did not meet its obligation to provide an adequate screening, which is not influenced by the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. it's important to gather comprehensive evidence showing that the hospital's screening was insufficient and directly led to harm or a worsened medical condition. legal action under emtala for inadequate mse must be filed within two years of the violation. these cases can be complex, and the specifics of each situation significantly impact

with a legal professional who has experience in military law can provide clarity and guidance tailored to your situation. this is especially relevant in the navy, where regulations and policies can have nuances that are different from civilian employment law.", "a:in california, financial institutions are not permitted to change a beneficiary designation after the account holder's death without a legal order or clear evidence of the account holder's intent made prior to death. if they informed you of a posthumous change, that raises concerns. the purpose of a beneficiary designation is to ensure the account holder's wishes are fulfilled upon their passing. if you believe there has been an improper alteration, you may have grounds to challenge this decision. you should gather all communications and documents related to the account and the beneficiary designation. if the financial institution does not provide a satisfactory explanation or remedy, legal action might be necessary. consulting an attorney experienced in estate and probate matters is advisable to protect your interests and ensure the proper distribution of your father's assets. ensure you act promptly to address any potential discrepancies or unauthorized changes.", 'a:you can ask for whatever amount you like. awards of damages for mental anguish vary depending upon the facts and circumstances presented by the evidence to the jury. a decent rule of thumb for settlement purposes is no more than 1.5x the amount of your medical expenses for whatever bodily injuries were caused to you as a result of whatever was wrong with the truck that is the responsibility of the defendant. but again, it is very situational. if the truck broke down on a busy highway causing your injuries and other cars were zooming past all around you, you would probably get more damages for mental anguish than if it happened in your driveway or on a quiet neighborhood street', 'a:the texas department of public safety regulates and licenses the private security industry in texas. to become a licensed security guard in the state of texas, you must first complete the level ii training course and test. all commissioned and non-commissioned (armed and unarmed) security officers must go through this training. the training must be taken at a licensed school and taught by a licensed instructor. the “dos” and “don’ts” are adequately covered in the course material. additional training and tests may be necessary depending upon your particular job duties. many of these additional requirements are discussed in the basic coursework. your employer should be able to give you more information as to the requirements for this position. occasionally, an employer will have no clue and will depend upon you as the licensed security officer to know and follow the applicable rules. this is particularly true if you are hired as an independent contractor rather than as a true employee. be aware that individuals can be fined for violating dps rules.', "a:under california law, if you have entered into a lump sum contract with a hud or rd rider limiting the general contractor's (gc) profit to 14%, but suspect they are making more, you have certain rights to review documentation. the lump sum based on unit price should have clear, itemized components, which allows for transparency in billing and cost allocation. as a party to the contract, you can request backup documentation, such as subcontractor agreements, to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and the profit cap. this is a reasonable request, especially in scenarios where there's a discrepancy or suspicion of overcharging. keep in mind that the gc is obliged to adhere to the contract terms, including the profit cap. if there's evidence of non-compliance, you may have grounds for legal action. it's advisable to review the contract details and, if necessary, seek guidance on the specific procedures and legal recourses available in such situations. remember, the integrity of the contractual agreement is paramount, and both parties must uphold their end of the bargain.", 'a:i cannot give you a specific recommendation, as these types of elder law matters are highly fact specific. however, you might want to look into the caregiver child exemption. normally you cannot transfer the home within 5 years of the application for medicaid benefits or it will result in a transfer penalty. however, if a child resided in the home with the person needing care for two years and that child provided care that kept the person out of a nursing home, alabama medicaid allows the home to pass to the child without penalty. there are other exceptions to the transfer penalty rules. another example is the disabled child exemption. if a child is "disabled," then the person needing care can transfer their home to that child without penalty. good luck to you and your family. these situations can be difficult.', 'a:your legal options are: 1) bankruptcy; 2) borrow money and pay off the note; 3) sell the car and pay off the note; 4) don’t voluntarily repo bc it won’t reduce the debt by much. even if repoed, you

is merely saying or implying, "if you sue me, bad things about you will be revealed", there\'s nothing unlawful about that threat. of course, if she makes false statements to third parties that are damaging to your reputation, you would have a potential defamation claim, and if she were to contact your employer or someone with whom you have a business relationship with the intent to ruin that relationship, you would have a potential claim for that. also, saying, "i have dirt on you" is not the crime of blackmail unless she were to say something like, "unless you do _____ for me, i\'m going to reveal to _____ the dirt i have on you."', "a:in general, when a person entitled to record a construction lien is in privily with the property owner, no notice to owner is required as a precondition. again, in very general terms, the right impose a construction lien is based upon services performed under the contract's particular scope of work and obligation to pay, so if there are two separate contracts, there would be two separate obligations and amounts due to be secured by the lien. all that said, there are always exceptions to any general rule, and ss with most issues regarding construction disputes, it is always prudent (especially for a business involved in the trade) to engage consult with counsel at the earliest possible opportunity to, ideally, avoid problems, protect your position, to adopt strategies to get projects back on track, and/or to minimize potential damages.", "a:it's hard to say - trial judges are very knowledgeable about issues of jurisdiction and venue, and given state and fed civil procedure rules, most cases are fairly clear-cut. it's possible that this is a very difficult setting - but that's only a general guess based on the limited details. an attorney in your jurisdiction would probably be able to advise more definitively. good luck", 'a:typically, when you lease a brand new car, it comes with a warranty from the manufacturer.

action against the debt collector.", 'a:it would be a medical malpractice case. due to the nature of medical malpractice cases, the extent anticipated may affect the viability of your case. consult with experienced medical malpractice attorneys in the state where this occurred.', 'a:simple possession is a class a misdemeanor punishable by 11 months and 29 days in the detention facility. realistically, if you were released on a citation and do not have a criminal history it is likely that you would get probation. however, you do not want to simply plead guilty to the simple possession because it will remain on your record on background checks for a minimum of six (6) years, 1 year of probation then depending on your history you may be able to get it expunged 5 years after you complete probation. your attorney may be able to get the charge dismissed through either a pass-and-dismiss, judicial diversion, dismissal at a hearing, or some other agreement that may prevent you from being found guilty. defense attorneys across the country are litigating over whether the plain smell of weed is enough to search a vehicle. most recently, tennessee courts ruled that it is a valid search but defense attorneys anticipate a similar plain-smell search case being brought before the tennessee supreme court or possibly the u.s. supreme court.', 'a:the area of law you are flirting with is fraught with great danger; those who do not retain an experienced lawyer before stepping into the line of fire very often greatly regret doing so. advising the public on how to buy and sell securities is the job that licensed stock brokers and brokerage houses do; merely disclaiming your financial advisory services does nothing to change the nature of what you are trying to do.', 'a:if you accidentally sent your tax refund to someone else on cash app, you may be able to request a refund of the payment. however, it will depend on a few factors, such as whether the

home screen to view your transaction history. find the transaction in question and tap on it to view the details. tap on the "..." icon in the top-right corner of the screen. tap on "refund" and follow the on-screen instructions. if the recipient has already accepted the payment or withdrawn the funds, it may not be possible to request a refund through cash app. in this case, you may want to

depends on several factors, including the age of both the beneficiary and their spouse. generally, a spouse can start receiving benefits based on their partner's record at age 62. however, if they

for spousal benefits. however, it's important to note that these benefits would be reduced because she is not at full retirement age. the full retirement age varies depending on the year of birth, and

significant legal risks, even if the character is often sexualized by the public. if the content is for profit, this can weigh against a fair use defense. the fact that the character is copyrighted

comics, and using it in your business name without permission could lead to trademark infringement issues. before finalizing the name "tracy batgirls dog rescue," you should conduct a thorough search to ensure it doesn\'t infringe on existing trademarks. this search can be done through the united states patent and trademark office (uspto) database. if the name is potentially infringing, it\'s advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. obtaining permission would involve contacting dc comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. if you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. this could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. in summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it\'s crucial to ensure that the name you choose does not violate trademark laws. consulting with an attorney experienced in intellectual property law can provide you with guidance and help safeguard your rescue from potential legal complications.',

this formalizes your legal ownership and is important for any future transactions involving the property, such as selling or refinancing. the type of deed most commonly used in these situations is a "grant deed." a grant deed guarantees that the property hasn\'t been sold to someone else and that there are no undisclosed encumbrances or liens against it. it\'s a straightforward way to ensure your

medical screening upon admission to a hospital could be viable under the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala). emtala mandates that hospitals provide an appropriate medical screening examination (mse) to anyone seeking emergency medical care to determine if an emergency medical condition exists. if a hospital fails to perform an adequate mse and the patient suffers harm as a result, it may be grounds for an emtala violation. the key aspect in such cases is demonstrating that the hospital did not meet its obligation to provide an adequate screening, which is not influenced by the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. it's important to gather comprehensive evidence showing that the hospital's screening was insufficient and directly led to harm or a worsened medical condition. legal action under emtala for inadequate mse must be filed within two years of the violation. these cases can be complex, and the specifics of each situation significantly impact
