infringing, it\\'s advisable to consider an alternative name or seek permission from the trademark holder. obtaining permission would involve contacting dc comics or their legal representatives to request a licensing agreement. if you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. this could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. in summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it\\'s crucial to ensure that the

hospital fails to perform an adequate mse and the patient suffers harm as a result, it may be grounds for an emtala violation. the key aspect in such cases is demonstrating that the hospital did not meet its obligation to provide an adequate screening, which is not influenced by the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. it's important to gather comprehensive evidence showing that the

if so maybe he has a case to bring against you. frankly the facts as told by you do not impress me as being a good basis to sue. but that is just my opinion and i recommend you and your father consult other lawyers immediately who are experienced in the field of aviation law. i am not an aviation lawyer and i do not handle injury cases.', \"a:no, that is not always the case. there are several factors to take into account outside of the actual bodily injury aspects of the policy, which sometimes get overlooked. some of those include: 1.) property damage coverage for punitives if punitive conduct can be shown; 2.) assets of the individual tortfeasor; 3.) other potential defendants (why did this person hit you - blocked view, drunk, etc.) that may have some liability 4.) if insurance company fails to pay policy limits timely, there might be an open policy scenario where the insurance company itself is also responsible for the full extent of the harm. you should always consult with an experience personal injury and insurance lawyer before making any final decisions about your case. any other questions, don't hesitate to reach out.\", \"a:in dealing with the issue of your child's father seeing the kids inconsistently and involving the police when visitation is denied, it's important to have a clear understanding of your legal rights and obligations. if there is a custody agreement or court order in place, it's crucial to follow the terms outlined in that document. if the father's visitation rights are specified, denying access could lead to legal complications for you. if there is no formal agreement or court order, it's advisable to establish one. this can be done through family court. a formal agreement or court order will provide clear guidelines for both parents regarding visitation rights and schedules. in the meantime, if the father calls the police during a dispute over visitation, the police will typically check to ensure the children's safety but may not intervene in custody disputes without a court order. for guidance specific to your situation, consider consulting with a family law attorney. an attorney can help you understand your rights and assist in creating or modifying a custody agreement that works in the best interest of your children. remember, it's important to address these issues legally and formally to avoid ongoing conflicts and ensure the well-being of your children.\"]\n",

characters presents significant legal risks, even if the character is often sexualized by the public. if the content is for profit, this can weigh against a fair use defense. the fact that the

circumstances presented. it's also advisable to consult with a legal professional familiar with federal court procedures to ensure compliance with all relevant rules and timelines. this can help in

request a licensing agreement. if you decide to proceed with this name without securing permission and it is deemed an infringement, you could face legal challenges, including a cease and desist order or a lawsuit. this could result in financial losses and the need to rebrand your organization. in summary, while the intent behind your dog rescue is commendable, it\\'s crucial to ensure that the

hospital fails to perform an adequate mse and the patient suffers harm as a result, it may be grounds for an emtala violation. the key aspect in such cases is demonstrating that the hospital did not meet its obligation to provide an adequate screening, which is not influenced by the patient's insurance status or ability to pay. it's important to gather comprehensive evidence showing that the hospital's screening was insufficient and directly led to harm or a worsened medical condition. legal action under emtala for inadequate mse must be filed within two years of the violation. these

(armed and unarmed) security officers must go through this training. the training must be taken at a licensed school and taught by a licensed instructor. the “dos” and “don’ts” are adequately covered in the course material. additional training and tests may be necessary depending upon your particular job duties. many of these additional requirements are discussed in the basic coursework. your employer should be able to give you more information as to the requirements for this position. occasionally, an employer will have no clue and will depend upon you as the licensed security officer to know and follow the applicable rules. this is particularly true if you are hired as an independent contractor rather than as a true employee. be aware that individuals can be fined for violating dps rules.', \"a:under california law, if you have entered into a lump sum contract with a hud or rd rider limiting the general contractor's (gc) profit to 14%, but suspect they are making more, you have certain rights to review documentation. the lump sum based on unit price should have clear, itemized components, which allows for transparency in billing and cost allocation. as a party to the contract, you can request backup documentation, such as subcontractor agreements, to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and the profit cap. this is a reasonable request, especially in scenarios where there's a discrepancy or suspicion of overcharging. keep in mind that the gc is obliged to adhere to the contract terms, including the profit cap. if there's evidence of non-compliance, you may have grounds for legal action. it's advisable to review the contract details and, if necessary, seek guidance on the specific procedures and legal recourses available in such situations. remember, the integrity of the contractual agreement is paramount, and both parties must uphold their end of the bargain.\", 'a:i cannot give you a specific recommendation, as these types of elder law matters are highly fact specific. however, you might want to look into the caregiver child exemption. normally you cannot transfer the home within 5 years of the application for medicaid benefits or it will result in a transfer penalty. however, if a child resided in the home with the person needing care for two years and that child provided care that kept the person out of a nursing home, alabama medicaid allows the home to pass to the child without penalty. there are other exceptions to the transfer penalty rules. another example is the disabled child exemption. if a child is

realistically, if you were released on a citation and do not have a criminal history it is likely that you would get probation. however, you do not want to simply plead guilty to the simple possession because it will remain on your record on background checks for a minimum of six (6) years, 1 year of probation then depending on your history you may be able to get it expunged 5 years after you complete probation. your attorney may be able to get the charge dismissed through either a pass-and-dismiss, judicial diversion, dismissal at a hearing, or some other agreement that may prevent you
