      " <s>[INST] In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

      " <s>[INST] In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names. Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \"trophy\" and \"suitcase\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \"small\" to \"big\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

I was approaching a slow moving farm tractor (travelling less than 25 mph) , i began to slow but had sufficent sight to know there were no on coming hazards, so i proceeded to pass him to the left, the entire time i was sure to watch the farmer as well. Without him looking or signaling he began to make a left tutn and subsequently hit my back passenger side as i was coming around him. Am i at fault? My vehicle flipoed 3 times and is totalled. If im at fault im ok with that,, as i cant see anything i wouldve done different besides just not going to pass him at all. Ive tried to find the laes concerning this but am not having any luck.

      " A:A North Carolina attorney could advise best, but your question remains open for a week. The insurance company has a reasonable argument they provided a rental and that that rental companies do charge deposits - the amount can vary by company. The court may see them favorably in light of this - but other attorneys could see it differently. You could consult with an attorney if it is worth pursuing, either through a law firm or on your own.

My family and I have been trying to get her the help she desperately needs with no luck at all. She simply gets nasty and aggressive. The staff are worried she will lose her legs.

Claim against me for a car accident I was in last year. The issue is I was never in accident. I followed up with my insurance today and they claim the other parties lawyer , car insurance and police department won’t release accident report to my car insurance? I’m very confused and just don’t want the hassle. My insurance company said they will keep me posted but I really don’t want to think about this. I’ve never received paper work of any kind from a lawyer claiming I was responsible for injury. What are my options? \n",
      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL:\n",
      " A:Your insurance company is required to keep you informed and provide to you information. Unfortunately, even though you do not want to be bothered, this is something that can happen. You should be able to obtain from the insurance company the claim made by the allegedly injured person. Until a lawsuit is filed, it is limited what can be obtained. You could, theoretically, file a lawsuit yourself to determine what occurred but it would not be a good use of resources.\n",
