I was approaching a slow moving farm tractor (travelling less than 25 mph) , i began to slow but had sufficent sight to know there were no on coming hazards, so i proceeded to pass him to the left, the entire time i was sure to watch the farmer as well. Without him looking or signaling he began to make a left tutn and subsequently hit my back passenger side as i was coming around him. Am i at fault? My vehicle flipoed 3 times and is totalled. If im at fault im ok with that,, as i cant see anything i wouldve done different besides just not going to pass him at all. Ive tried to find the laes concerning this but am not having any luck.

      " A:A North Carolina attorney could advise best, but your question remains open for a week. The insurance company has a reasonable argument they provided a rental and that that rental companies do charge deposits - the amount can vary by company. The court may see them favorably in light of this - but other attorneys could see it differently. You could consult with an attorney if it is worth pursuing, either through a law firm or on your own.

My family and I have been trying to get her the help she desperately needs with no luck at all. She simply gets nasty and aggressive. The staff are worried she will lose her legs.

Claim against me for a car accident I was in last year. The issue is I was never in accident. I followed up with my insurance today and they claim the other parties lawyer , car insurance and police department won’t release accident report to my car insurance? I’m very confused and just don’t want the hassle. My insurance company said they will keep me posted but I really don’t want to think about this. I’ve never received paper work of any kind from a lawyer claiming I was responsible for injury. What are my options? \n",
      " ### Answer:\n",
      "REAL:\n",
      " A:Your insurance company is required to keep you informed and provide to you information. Unfortunately, even though you do not want to be bothered, this is something that can happen. You should be able to obtain from the insurance company the claim made by the allegedly injured person. Until a lawsuit is filed, it is limited what can be obtained. You could, theoretically, file a lawsuit yourself to determine what occurred but it would not be a good use of resources.\n",
